### Licenses

You can manage Copilot licenses, including assigning and unassigning licenses, for your users.

### Manage how your organization interacts with Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge

Bing Chat Enterprise provides enhanced commercial data protection for users accessing the generative AI capabilities of Bing Chat. Use this setting to navigate enabling or disabling Bing Chat Enterprise, as well as Bing Chat.

### Manage plugins that work with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft 365 Copilot is powered by an advanced processing and orchestration engine that seamlessly integrates Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Graph, and large language models (LLMs) to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool. While Copilot is already able to use the apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many users still depend on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. You can extend Microsoft 365 Copilot by building a plugin or by connecting to an external data source.
This control navigates you to the Integrated App settings to control how non-Microsoft apps can work with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

### Public web content access

This control allows you to enable or disable Copilot’s ability to access the public web to get the latest information available when responding to prompts. Note that this is a separate control from Bing Chat Enterprise. Learn more about [how to Manage access to public web content in Microsoft 365 Copilot responses](manage-public-web-access.md).

### Data Security and Compliance

### Security Copilot

This setting directs you to the Security Copilot portal to manage settings. Security Copilot is a separate product and license from Microsoft 365 Copilot. If purchased, you can use this link to navigate to Microsoft Security Copilot settings page. To learn more, see [Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/).
