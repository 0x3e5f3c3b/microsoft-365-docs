  - Perform several types of indicator searches to gather vulnerability intelligence

    ![Tutorial Vulnerability Intel Articles](media/tutorialVulnerabilityIntelArticles.md)

## Prerequisites
  - An Azure or M365 Active Directory account with an active tenant. [Login or create an account](https://signup.microsoft.com/)  
  - A Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) Premium or Community license. [Join our Defender TI Community]  
> [!NOTE]
> Users that have been downgraded to our Community license can still perform the tutorial. However, certain data sets will not be viewable and Community licensed users will have limited access to the history of our data sets.  

## Disclaimer  
Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) may include live, real-time observations and threat indicators, including malicious infrastructure and adversary-threat tooling. Any IP and domain searches within our Defender TI platform are safe to search.  
Microsoft will share online resources (e.g., IP addresses, domain names) that should be considered real threats posing a clear and present danger.  
We ask that users use their best judgment and minimize unnecessary risk while interacting with malicious systems when performing the tutorial below. Please note that Microsoft has worked to minimize risk by defanging malicious IP addresses, hosts, and domains.  


## Before You Begin  
As the disclaimer states above, suspicious, and malicious indicators have been defanged for your safety. Please remove any brackets from IPs, domains, and hosts when searching in Defender TI. Do not search these indicators directly in your browser.  

##Open Defender TI’s Threat Intelligence Home Page  
  - Access the [Defender Threat Intelligence Portal](https://ti.defender.microsoft.com/).
  - Complete Microsoft authentication to access portal.  

## Learn about Defender TI’s Threat Intelligence Home Page features  
  1. Review the Search bar options by selecting the search bar and clicking on the All drop-down option.
