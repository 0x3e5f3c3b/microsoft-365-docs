# Microsoft Copilot for Security and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence

Microsoft Copilot for Security is a cloud-based AI platform that provides natural language copilot experience. It can help support security professionals in different scenarios, like incident response, threat hunting, and intelligence gathering. For more information about what it can do, read [What is Microsoft Copilot for Security?](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot).

**Copilot for Security integrates with Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence**

Copilot for Security delivers from Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) information about threat actors, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and tools, as well as contextual threat intelligence. You can use the prompts and promptbooks to investigate incidents, enrich your hunting flows with threat intelligence information, or gain more knowledge about your organization's or the global threat landscape. 

This article introduces you to Copilot and includes sample prompts that can help Defender TI users.

## Know before you begin
- You can experience the integration of Copilot for Security with Defender TI through the [dedicated site](#using-defender-ti-in-copilot-for-security-standalone-site) (also known as the **standalone** experience) or through the [Microsoft Defender XDR portal](#using-copilot-for-security-on-defender-ti-in-microsoft-defender-xdr) (**embedded** experience). [Learn more about Microsoft Copilot for Security experiences](/security-copilot/experiences-security-copilot)
- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific threat actor names or IOCs in your prompts. It might also help if you add **threat intelligence** to your prompt, like:
  - Show me threat intelligence data for Aqua Blizzard.
  - Summarize threat intelligence data for "malicious.com."
- Be specific when referencing an incident (for example, "incident ID 15324").
- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.
- Copilot for Security saves your prompt sessions. To see the previous sessions, from the Copilot [Home menu](/security-copilot/navigating-security-copilot#home-menu), go to **My sessions**.
