# Get started with Advanced eDiscovery

Advanced eDiscovery in Microsoft 365 provides an end-to-end workflow to preserve, collect, review, analyze, and export data that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. To get started with Advanced eDiscovery, there's nothing to deploy: you can just start using it. However, there are some prerequisite tasks that an IT admin and eDiscovery manager in your organization have to complete before you or others can start creating and using Advanced eDiscovery cases to manage legal or other types of investigations.

This article discusses the steps necessary set up  Advanced eDiscovery so people in your organization can start using it. This includes ensuring the proper licensing required to access Advanced eDiscovery and add custodians to cases, and assigning permissions to your legal and investigation team so they can access and manage cases. This article also provides a high-level overview of using cases to manage the Advanced eDiscovery workflow for a legal investigation.


## Step 1: Verify and assign appropriate licenses

Licensing for Advanced eDiscovery requires the appropriate organization subscription and per-user licensing.

- **Organization subscription:** To access the Advanced eDiscovery tool in the Microsoft 365 compliance center or the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, your organization must have Office 365 or Microsoft E5 subscription. 

- **Per-user licensing:** - To add a user as a custodian in an Advance eDiscovery case, that user must be assigned one of the following licenses, depending on your organization subscription:

  - **Microsoft 365:** Users must be assigned a Microsoft 365 E5 license or an E5 Compliance add-on license.

  - **Office 365:** Users must be assigned an Office 365 E5 license or an Advanced Compliance add-on license.

  Users only need an E5 license to be added as a custodian to an Advanced eDiscovery case. IT admins, eDiscovery managers, lawyers, paralegals, or investigators who use Advanced eDiscovery to manage cases or review case data do not need an E5 license.
