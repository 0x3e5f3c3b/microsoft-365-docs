# Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Forms activity

The Microsoft 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
For example, you can understand the activity of every user licensed to use Microsoft Forms by looking at their interaction with forms. It also helps you to understand the level of collaboration going on by looking at the number of forms created and forms the user responded to.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, global reader or reports reader in Microsoft 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Teams Service, Teams Communications, or Skype for Business administrator to see reports. 

## How to get to the Forms activity report

1. In the admin center, go to the **Reports** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2074756" target="_blank">Usage</a> page.

    
2. From the **Select a report** drop-down, select **Forms** \> **activity**.

## Interpret the forms activity report

You can get a view into your user's forms activity by looking at the **Activity** and **Users** charts.

|:-----|:-----|
|1.  <br/> |The **Forms activity** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table (7) will show data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).  <br/> |
|2.  <br/> |The data in each report usually covers up to the last 24 to 48 hours.  <br/> |
|3.  <br/> |The **Users** view helps you to understand the trend in the number of active forms users. A user is considered active if he or she has executed a activity around a form (create, edit, view, etc.) or responded to a form within the specific time period.  <br/> |
|4.  <br/> |The **Activity** view helps you to understand the trend in the number of active users. A user is considered active if he or she has executed a file activity (save, sync, modify, or share) or visited a page within the specific time period.<br/> NOTE: An activity can occur multiple times for a single form, but will count only as one active form. For example, you can create a form and continue to edit the same form multiple times over a specified time period, but it will count only as one single form. However if a user submitted multiple responses for the same form, each response would still be an individual response and thus be counted multiple times. <br/> |
|5.<br/>|On the **Users** chart, the Y axis is the number of unique users. X axis is the date that the unique users are active on. The legends are:<br/><br/>**Designers** means the user has created or edited a form.<br/>**Responders** means that the user has submitted response(s) to a form.<br/> **Total users** means anyone in the company who has been a designer or responder.<br/><br/> On the **Activity** chart, the Y axis is the count of unique forms or responses. X axis is the date that the form or response activity occurred. The legends are:<br/><br/>**Forms created** is the count of unique forms that the users have created.<br/> **Signed in responses** the count of signed in responses the users in the organization have received.<br/> **Anonymous responses** is the count of anonymous responses the users in the organization have received.<br/><br/>|
|6.<br/>|You can filter the series you see on the chart by selecting an item in the legend. For example, on the Users chart, select designers, responders, or total users to see only the info related to each one. Changing this selection doesn't change the info in the grid table below it.|
|7.<br/>|The table shows you a breakdown of the activities at the per-user level.The legends are:<br/><br/>**Username** is the email address of the user who performed the activity on Microsoft Forms.<br/>**Last activity date (UTC)** is the latest date a form activity was performed by the user for the selected date range. To see activity that occurred on a specific date, select the date directly in the chart.<br/><br/>This will filter the table to display file activity data only for users who performed the activity on that specific day.<br/><br/>**Number of forms created** is the number of forms that the user created.<br/> **Number of forms responded** is the number of forms that the user has submitted responses to.|
|8.<br/>|Select the **Manage columns** icon to add or remove columns from the report.|
|9.<br/>|You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file by selecting the **Export** link. This exports data for all users and enables you to do simple aggregation, sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 100 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. If you have more than 100 users, in order to filter and sort, you will need to export the data.|
