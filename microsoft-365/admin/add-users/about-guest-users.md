# Guest users in Microsoft 365 admin center

When you add guests to your Microsoft Teams, or SharePoint, those users are added to the Guest users list in the admin center. You can also add guest users in the Azure Active Directory so they can collaborate with your organization's users. Guest users can attend meetings, view documents and chat in Teams they are invited to.
Once a user is added to the Guest users list, you can remove their access there.

To view guest users, in the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left nav, expand **Users**, and then choose **Guest users**.
