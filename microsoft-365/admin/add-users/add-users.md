# Add users individually or in bulk

The people on your team each need a user account before they can sign in and access [Microsoft 365 for business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=519395). The easiest way to add user accounts is to add them one at a time in the Microsoft 365 admin center. After you do this step, your users will have Microsoft 365 licenses, sign in credentials, and Microsoft 365 mailboxes.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global admin, or a User management admin to add users and assign licenses. For more information, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you create users by migrating mail boxes, you must activate user accounts by assigning licenses. If you don't assign a license to a user, their mailbox will be disabled after a grace period of 30 days. See how to [assign licenses to users](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Add multiple users at the same time

You can use any of the following methods to add multiple users at the same time:
  
- **Use a spreadsheet to add people in bulk.** To learn how, see [Add several users at the same time](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/add-several-users-at-the-same-time).
- **Automate adding accounts and assigning licenses.** To learn how, see [Create user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/powershell/create-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell). Choose this method if you're already familiar with using Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
- **Using ActiveDirectory?** [Set up directory synchronization for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/set-up-directory-synchronization). Use the Azure AD Connect tool to replicate Active Directory user accounts (and other Active Directory objects) in Microsoft 365. The sync only adds the user accounts. You must assign licenses to the synced users before they can use email and other Office apps.
- **Migrating from Exchange?** See [Ways to migrate multiple email accounts to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration). When you migrate multiple mailboxes to Microsoft 365 by using either cutover, staged, or a hybrid Exchange method, you automatically add users as part of the migration. The migration only adds the user accounts. You must assign licenses to the users before they can use email and other Office apps. If you don't assign a license to a user, their mailbox is disabled after a grace period of 30 days. Learn how to [assign licenses to users](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Next steps

After you add a user, you get an email notification from Microsoft. The email contains the person's user ID and password so they can sign in to Microsoft 365. Use your normal process for communicating new passwords. Be sure to share the [Employee quickstart guide](https://support.microsoft.com/office/b9700090-ce64-4046-ab92-ce8488a7bc0f) with your new users to set up things, like how to [download and install Office apps on a PC or Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/office/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658) and how to [set up Office apps and email on a mobile device](https://support.microsoft.com/office/7dabb6cb-0046-40b6-81fe-767e0b1f014f).
