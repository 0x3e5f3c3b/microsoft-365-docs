# Title

Add intro text here, if needed.

## Before you begin

<!-- Include this section for how-to articles only. List anything that's required before the user begins the task. If there are multiple requirements, add them as a bulleted list. Include things like required permissions or admin roles, required licenses/plans/add-ons, system requirements, links to tasks that must be completed before beginning this one, etc. -->

## Heading (include multiple headings, as needed)

<!-- For overview articles, explain a service, technology, or functionality from a technical point of view. Overview articles are intended for new customers, but are NOT intended to define benefits or serve as a value prop. -->
<!-- For conceptual articles, provide an in-depth explanation of a service, technology, or functionality that's fundamental to understanding and using it. -->
<!-- For reference articles, provide things like settings, values, features, and configurations in a table format, if possible. Include brief descriptions. Reference articles are used to look up specific values or information and may be referenced frequently. -->
<!-- For how-to articles, include step-by-step instructions for how to perform a task. Include a one- or two-sentence lead-in to the task, if needed. If your how-to article documents a scenario and contains multiple tasks, consider putting the tasks in separate articles if including them all in one article makes it too long and daunting for users. You can always chain tasks in a scenario by including a "Next steps" section (described below) that briefly describes and links to the next task. -->

1. Step 1 text.
2. Step 2 text. 
3. Step 3 text. 

### Sub-heading (optional)

<!-- Include sub-headings, if needed. -->

## Watch: Name of video (optional)

<!-- If you include a video in your article, put it under its own H1 heading so it shows up in the "In this article" list on the right-hand side of the article. -->

## Next steps (optional)

<!-- Include this section for how-to articles only, if needed. Recommend the next logical action or actions to take after completing the task(s) outlined in the article. Include links to relevant how-to articles (such as the next task to complete in a scenario), links to recommended reading, or any other info that you think users should or might want to do next. -->

## Related content
<!-- Include a list of links, but do NOT use bullets. Next to each link, include the content type (choose from: article, video, blog post) in parentheses. See examples below. -->

[Video title](https://docs.microsoft.com) (video)
