# AI Assistance Category in Adoption Score

With AI rapidly entering the day-to-day experience of people in your organization, you'll see a new People Experiences category called AI assistance, set to roll out in the coming weeks.

First, it offers a score, on a 100-point scale, to quickly assess how well people in your organization are adopting Copilot in Microsoft 365.

You can dive deeper into what makes up your AI assistance score by looking at the specific features and activities that drive impact, like how well your organization is using Copilot to summarize and create content in your organization, be it Teams meetings, Chat, email in Outlook, documents in Word or PowerPoint and more.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Copilot Insights, people in your organization need to be licensed for:

- Microsoft Copilot

After people have been active in Copilot at least once in the last 28 days, you'll start to see the insights.

## Scoring framework

The AI assistance score for your organization measures at an aggregate (organizational) level whether users are consistently using Copilot capabilities across Microsoft 365 apps within the last 28 days.

Scores aren't provided at the individual user level.

## Overall score

The overall score takes into account individual user activity (each tenant) across different insights in summarization and creation (of documents, emails and presentations) in RL28 day time frame, with a focus that better use of Copilot best practices leads to a better score.  

Further, a user score is calculated with the usage intensity of individual user and the possible utilization threshold (12 days as of now) of Copilot activity in mind. The tenant AI Assistance scores are created by the combination of user scores of each tenant and the number of individuals enabled to use Copilot (for the applications considered).

## What makes up my score

There are two sections of insights: summarize and create. The summarize section captures all the information and data summarization across meetings and messages, sparing users the labor of sorting it out from notes and complex chat or email threads. The create section captures the user actions to get past the roadblock of staring at a blank page by jump-starting their creative process and helping to streamline the tasks of researching, writing, and editing across Microsoft 365 apps with the help of Copilot capabilities.

Each insight captures the number of Copilot-enabled users in your organization performing these actions at least once out of the total number who are enabled to perform in the last 28 days. You can find more details on insights within the following sections.
