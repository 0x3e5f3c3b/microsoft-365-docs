# Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program

The Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program is an invitation-only paid preview that will roll out to a select group of customers worldwide. If your organization is interested in the early release program, work with your Microsoft account manager to find out more details about nominations for a potential invite. The program includes licenses for Microsoft 365 Copilot within the Microsoft 365 apps (Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and more).

## Before you begin

Make sure that your organization is prepared for Microsoft 365 Copilot. To learn more about prerequisites and licensing requirements, see [Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot](m365-copilot-setup.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about Microsoft 365 Copilot.

### Q: What happens after my organization gets invited into the program?

A: Work directly with your account manager to confirm acceptance. After accepting the invitation, users with the Global admin role permissions in the organization will receive an email to complete the process in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Q: What are the top benefits of the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program?

A: With the Early Access Program, you can use Copilot prior to the general release of the product and can receive extra engineering support to deploy Copilot and promote adoption. You also have the opportunity to test use cases and provide feedback to influence the development of the product.

### Q: Can I cancel my organization’s participation in the Early Access Program? If yes, am I eligible for refund?  

A: You have seven days to cancel the purchase. After seven days, there are no refunds available, as this is a limited time program.

### Q: My organization has multiple tenants, can I assign licenses across tenants?

A: No. During the Early Access Program, Copilot can only be deployed in one tenant and licenses can only be assigned to users in that tenant.

### Q: What is the Microsoft Customer Agreement?

A: The Microsoft Customer Agreement provides a consistent and simplified purchasing experience. Learn more [here](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/how-to-buy/microsoft-customer-agreement).

### Q: Does accepting the Microsoft Customer Agreement impact my existing Microsoft Enterprise Agreements?

A: No, the Microsoft Customer Agreement doesn’t impact the terms of existing Enterprise Agreements.

### Q: How am I invoiced and what is different about these licenses?

A: The Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Pass is a one-time invoice and purchase. You can find your invoice in the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to Billing > [Bills & payments](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/billoverview/invoice-list) page. There’s no difference between Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses and other Microsoft 365 product licenses. You can assign, unassign, and reassign these licenses just like any other license in Microsoft 365.

### Q: Where do I go to assign and manage licenses?

A: You can assign licenses to individual users in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Admin can manage and assign licenses by using PowerShell. Licenses can be reassigned to different users during the program.

### Q: What are technical requirements for using Microsoft 365 Copilot?

A: See [Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot](m365-copilot-setup.md) for the full list of technical requirements.

### Q: How do I prepare my organization’s data governance for Copilot?

A: Microsoft 365 Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits all your company’s valuable security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Data permissions will be consistent and users will only be able to search the information they already have access to. Review [Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot](/DeployOffice/privacy/microsoft-365-copilot) on how to approach getting your organization ready to use Copilot.
