# Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program

The Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program is an invitation-only paid preview that will roll out to a select group of customers worldwide. If your organization is interested in the early release program, work with your Microsoft account manager to find out more details about nominations for a potential invite. The program includes licenses for Microsoft 365 Copilot within the Microsoft 365 apps (Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and more).

## Before you begin

Make sure that your organization is prepared for Microsoft 365 Copilot. To learn more about prerequisites and licensing requirements, see [Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot](m365-copilot-setup.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions
