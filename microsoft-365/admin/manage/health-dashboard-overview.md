# Microsoft 365 Health dashboard

As the admin of your organization, you’re charged with keeping many apps and services running smoothly with a limited amount of time. We've created the Microsoft 365 Health dashboard to help you see apps and services are running in your organization.

The Health dashboard is designed to give you a snapshot of the health of your environment. You can see how well your organization is keeping desktop software up to date, following best practices for security, and using the products and services you’ve paid for.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Health dashboard is in public preview and may not be available to all customers.

## Health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Sign in to the admin center, and then go to this url: https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/healthoverview.

You need to be a member of the global admin role or global reader role to access the health dashboard.

### Critical alerts

:::image type="content" source="../../media/health-dashboard.png" alt-text="Health dashboard":::

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll see critical alerts about any issues that need your attention.  Three types of notifications will appear here:

- General service incidents

- Issues in your organization that need attention. For example, mailboxes about to reach their storage limit.

- Billing issues that may cause future problems, like an expired subscription.

If there are no alerts, a green banner lets you know that the health dashboard didn't find any issues.

### Service health and usage

In the center of the page, you’ll see current service health status of your top apps and services. This is a selected view of the top products. If you want to see the list of all your products you can follow the link to see the full list. This section also shows you average daily usage and usage trends for the past 30 days. This helps you understand how products are being used in your organization.

### Microsoft 365 app updates

To help you keep up to date with software updates, this section of the dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of whether Microsoft 365 desktop apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are up-to-date. If some devices have fallen behind, you’ll see a list of devices and vulnerabilities to help you understand the risk. This information is powered by the Software Updates page <add link>, which you can access for more information.

### Recommended actions

At the bottom of the dashboard, you’ll see recommendations on what you can do to improve your organization’s health:

- **Turn on multi-factor authentication**: See a summary of how many accounts are currently enabled for MFA, and a link to the MFA setup wizard.

- **Turn on monthly updates for Office**: See whether your organization's Office update frequency is set so that you receive updates more than once every six months.

- **Share OneDrive training**:  Encourage users to store files in OneDrive to help with recovery against ransomware or device failure. Send them them a video overview to help them set up and use OneDrive.

## Getting started with the dashboard  

What other alerts, health indicators, and monitoring would you like to see? Active Directory sync health and OneDrive sync health are two examples of things we’re considering. Let us know here in the comments or submit feedback directly from the Health dashboard.

## Note for Microsoft enterprise customers

A note for our enterprise customers: the initial version of this dashboard focuses on a small or solo IT teams where it is common for one person to manage the complete surface area of Microsoft 365. Over time we intend to expand and evolve the dashboard to address the needs of more IT roles and larger organization sizes. We’d love your input to make sure we get it right along that path; so if you have ideas of what would make it useful in your orgs, please send those too.

We’re excited to bring this dashboard to you.  We hope it will be a useful tool to help you keep tabs on the total health of your Microsoft 365 environment, so you can keep your organization up-to-date, secure, and productive.
