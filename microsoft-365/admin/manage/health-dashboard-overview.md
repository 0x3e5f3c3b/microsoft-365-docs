# Microsoft 365 Health dashboard

As the admin of your organization, you’re charged with keeping many apps and services running smoothly with a limited amount of time. We've created the Microsoft 365 Health dashboard to help you see apps and services are running in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Health dashboard is in public preview and may not be available to all customers.

This private preview of this new dashboard begins today.  You can access it by logging into the Microsoft 365 aAdmin cCenter and then visiting https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/healthoverview

 The Health dashboard is designed to give you a snapshot of the health of your environment.  You can see how well your organization is keeping desktop software up to date, following best practices for security, and using the products and services you’ve paid for.  

## Critical alerts

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll see critical alerts about any issues that need your attention.  Three types of notifications will appear here:

- General service incidents

- Issues in your organization that need attention, such as mailboxes about to reach their storage limit

- Billing issues that may cause problems if not addressed, such as a subscription that has expired.

If there are no alerts to show, a green banner is displayed to let you know that things look good.

## Service health and usage

In the center of the page you’ll see current service health status of top apps and services.  This is a view of the top products; if you want to see the exhaustive list of all products you can click a link to visit the full service health page.  This section also shows you average daily usage and usage trends for the past 30 days, to help you understand how extensively products are being used in your organization.

## Microsoft 365 app updates

Next on the dashboard is a section covering Microsoft 365 app updates. In today’s IT landscape, keeping software up-to-date is vital to maintaining a strong security posture.  To help you succeed in this ongoing effort, the dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of whether Microsoft 365 desktop apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are up-to-date.  If some devices have fallen behind, you’ll see how many devices and how many vulnerabilities, to help you understand the risk.  The information here is powered by the recently released Software Updates page <link>, which you can access for more information. 

## Recommended actions

At the bottom of the dashboard, you’ll see recommendation cards with suggestions on what you can do to improve your organization’s health.  Three recommendations are shown here:

- Activate multifactor authentication: You’ll see a summary of how many accounts are currently enabled for MFA, and a button that takes you to the MFA setup wizard.

- Enable monthly updates for Office: You’ll see whether your org’s Office update frequency is set so that you receive updates more often than every six months.

- Share OneDrive training:  To encourage users to store files in OneDrive and get better recovery against ransomware or device failure, you can send them a video overview

## Getting started with the dashboard  

Over the next few weeks, we’ll update the Health section of Microsoft 365 Admin Center navigation menu to show a link to the new Dashboard page.  But, if you want to get your hands on the page, you don’t need to wait.  You can access it today by logging into the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and going directly to the page at https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/healthoverview. The Global admin or Global reader role is required to access the page.  We recommend you bookmark the page for easy access until it appears on the navigation menu.  

After you’ve kicked the tires, we’d love to hear what you think of the dashboard.  What other alerts, health indicators, and monitoring would you like to see? Active Directory sync health and OneDrive sync health are two examples of things we’re considering.  Let us know here in the comments or submit feedback directly from the dashboard.  

A note for our enterprise customers: the initial version of this dashboard focuses on a small or solo IT teams where it is common for one person to manage the complete surface area of Microsoft 365. Over time we intend to expand and evolve the dashboard to address the needs of more IT roles and larger organization sizes. We’d love your input to make sure we get it right along that path; so if you have ideas of what would make it useful in your orgs, please send those too.

We’re excited to bring this dashboard to you.  We hope it will be a useful tool to help you keep tabs on the total health of your Microsoft 365 environment, so you can keep your organization up-to-date, secure, and productive.
