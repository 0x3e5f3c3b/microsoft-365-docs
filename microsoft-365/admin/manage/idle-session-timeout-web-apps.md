# Idle session timeout for Microsoft 365

<!-- Add metadata: localization, AdminSurgePortfolio, admindeeplinkMAC. remove robots nofollow -->

Use idle session timeouts to configure a policy on how long users are idle in your organization before they are signed out of Microsoft 365 web apps. This helps protect sensitive company data and adds another layer of security for end users who work on non-company or shared devices.

When a user reaches the idle timeout session you've set, they'll get a notification that they're about to be signed out. They have to select to stay signed in or they'll be automatically signed out of all Microsoft 365 web apps.

1. Go to the [![Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/e00ba917-c3fb-4173-b344-43eb5c7eeb15.png)](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/homepage).

2. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** \> **https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/Settings/SecurityPrivacy**. If you aren't an Office 365 global admin, you won't see the Security and privacy option.

3. Select **Idle Session Timeout** choose **Edit**.

4. On the **Idle Session Timeout** select the toggle to turn it on. You can choose a default setting or choose your own custom time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set up idle session timeout policies for Outlook web app and SharePoint Online, turning on idle session timeout in the admin center will override the Outlook web app and SharePoint settings.

Idle session timeout is one of the many security measures in Microsoft 365. To learn about other security tasks in Microsoft 365 see [Top security tasks in Microsoft 365](../../security/top-security-tasks-for-remote-work.md).
