# Microsoft product feedback and insights for your organization

As the admin of a Microsoft 365 organization, you can now see insights and data generated by users in your organization. We use surveys and feedback from your end-users to provide you with insights about Microsoft products and services. This information can help you find out about what products and services end-users in your organization are using, as well as help you identify issues and quickly resolve them. With this information you can:

- See location of users who have submitted feedback
- See what operating system or platform they're using
- Filter on date, survey, product, platform and search using keywords
- See end-user comments on the top products and issues
- Export feedback and survey information to a CSV file for further investigation
- See contact information for user who submitted the feedback
- Separate feedback by end-users or administrators
