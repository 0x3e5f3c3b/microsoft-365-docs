# Move users to a different subscription

If you have more than one subscription, and you have users who already have a license for one subscription, but you want to move them to another subscription, you can replace their existing license with a different one.

## Before you begin

- You must be a Global admin, Billing admin, License admin, or User management admin to assign licenses. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Move users to a different subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
2. Select the circles next to the names of the users you want to replace existing licenses for.
3. At the top, select **More options (...)**, then select **Manage product licenses**.
4. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, select **Replace existing product license assignments** > **Next**.
5. Switch the toggle to the **On** position for the licenses that you want to assign to these users.

    You can limit which services are available to the users. Switch the toggles to the **Off** position for the services that you don't want those users to have. Any previous license assignments for the selected users are removed.
6. At the bottom of the **Replace existing products** pane, select **Replace** > **Close**.

## Next steps

If you’re not going to reassign the unused licenses to other users, consider removing the licenses from your subscription so that you’re not paying for more licenses than you need.
