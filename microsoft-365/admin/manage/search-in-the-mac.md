# Search in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Search functionality has improved in the Microsoft 365 admin center. With the new search, you can now get search results even faster, and you can search from every page in the admin center. The search box has moved to the banner region at the top of the admin center where it says **Microsoft 365 admin center**. You can also use the Alt+S shortcut to search from any page, not just the home page.

**I'll add a screenshot here.**

## Before you begin

You need to be an administrator to search in the admin center.

## Search faster and get better results from any page

Search results are organized by the type of item or action you can take. Here's an overview of how search functionality works in a few different areas in the admin center.

- **Users**: Select the user's name and you can edit that user right there. If you select the "more actions" menu next to their name, you can reset their password. You can search by display name, last name, first name, username or primary email address, and email aliases. But to get an exact match, search by primary email address or username.
- **Groups**: Edit the group from any page, add members, assign owners.

- **Actions**: Similar to how you can search for a user and then reset their password, you can also search "reset password" from any page and then reset one or more passwords for users.

- **Navigation**: Results under Navigation can quickly help you get to a page in the admin center quickly. For example, searching "roles" will take you to the Roles page for Azure AD roles.

- **Settings**: Search for any setting related to your organization, the services you subscribe to, and security and privacy settings.

- **Domains**: You can find quick links to your domains, and then the link will take you to that domain's Overview and health page.

- **Documentation**: If we can't find a result for you, we'll try to find some documentation to help. It takes a little longer for the curated list of articles to find a match, so wait a second to let Search find the results.

- **Feedback**: Didn't find what you were looking for? Send us feedback from Search.
