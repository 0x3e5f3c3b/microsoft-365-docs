# Search in the Microsoft 365 admin center

As the administrator of a Microsoft 365 organization, you can use the search bar to search for users, perform actions, navigate to different settings, and send us feedback. With new search functionality, search speed has improved, and you can now search from every page in the admin center. The search box has moved to the banner region at the top of the admin center where it says **Microsoft 365 admin center**. You can also use the Alt+S shortcut to search from any page.

## Before you begin

You need to be an administrator to search in the admin center.

## Search faster and get better results from any page

Search results are organized in different categories. Most of these categories are either the actual items in Microsoft 365 admin center e.g., Users, Groups, Shared Mailboxes or Domains. We also have some categories devoted to places you can navigate to, actions you can take or app level settings that you can change. Finally, there is a category related to documentation.
The following sections describe the different areas/categories in the admin center that are searchable. To improve the searching speed, searches in these categories run simultaneously and results from one category are not affected by the other one.

## Users

Users can be found by display name, last name, first name, username, primary email address, or email aliases. Select the user's name edit to edit the user’s details.

If you select the "More actions" menu next to their name, you can reset their password.

**Tips to improve user search results**

- Make sure you spell the users'    names correctly as user searches are matched exactly against the earlier mentioned properties. For example, in the above example, Jus or Malz will work but misspelling like  for Jostin will not find this user.
- To get an exact match, search by primary email address or username.

## Groups

You can search for Groups by group name or group email address. You can select the Group and edit the group from any page.

**Tips to improve Group search results**

Make sure you spell the group name correctly.

## Actions

You can search for Actions category contains frequently used actions in M365 Admin Center. Think of actions as verb in the system. For example, you can also search "reset password" from any page and then reset one or more passwords for users. You can search for “delete a user” and delete the user from the Delete user page.

## Navigation

Results under Navigation category are an attempt to quickly help you get to a page in the admin center. For example, searching for RBAC will take you to the Roles page for Azure AD roles.

## Settings

Search for supported app level settings related to your organization, the services you subscribe to, and security and privacy settings.

## Domain

You can find quick links to your domains, and then the link will take you to that domain's overview page.

## Documentation

If we can’t find a result for you, we'll try to find some documentation to help. It takes a little longer for the curated list of articles to find a match, so wait a second to let search find the results.

## Search in the admin center feedback
