# Show or hide new features using What's New Management Preview

The Office What's New Management Preview allow your organization to decide which features are shown to or hidden from end users in the Office desktop app. Each release of Office includes new and improved features, and the preview allows you to view new content for each release version and channel, and choose whether to hide or show each feature's What's New content to end users. 

The What's New content in the Office desktop apps highlights an editorially curated list of new features being released for that application, with a short description, and often a picture or a video created by the team releasing the feature to help customers learn how to use the feature. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Global admin and Office Apps admin roles manage the What's New content that users see in their Office apps, as well as all cloud-based policies for Office.

##  Show or hide new features 

Admins can preview the What's New content for a channel, and manage the release of the content using the Office What's New Management Preview.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, choose **Settings**.

2. On the **Services** tab, choose **Office What's New Management Preview**.

3. Select one or more features to view the feature name, a short description, the application, and the release version for each feature on the flyout panel.

4. Choose **Hide from users** or **Show to users**.  

    The status **Shown by default** indicates feature information is shown by default to users until the admin sets the status for a feature to **Hidden** or **Shown**.  

New features appear in the Office What's New Management Preview based on the schedule in the following table:
