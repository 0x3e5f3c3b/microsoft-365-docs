# Show or hide new features using What's New Management

**Office What's New Management for Windows** allows your organization to decide which features are shown to end users in the Office desktop apps. The content preview allows you to view new content for each release version and channel. You can then choose whether to hide or show what's new content for each feature to end users. 

The **What's new content in the Office desktop apps** highlights a list of new features that is released for an application. It also contains a short description, and often a picture or a video to help customers learn how to use the feature. 

**Office What's New** management is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center and through the [Client Configuration Service](https://config.office.com).

> [!NOTE]
> Global admin and Office Apps admin roles manage the What's new content that users see in their Office apps.

##  Show or hide new features 

Admins can preview the **what's new** content for a channel, and manage the release of the content by using the **Office What's New** management.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, choose **Org settings**.
2. On the **Services** tab, choose **Office What's New management**.
3. Select one or more features to view the feature name, a short description, the target application, and the release version for each feature on the fly-out panel.
4. Choose **Hide from users** or **Show to users**.  
    The status **Shown by default** indicates feature information is shown by default to users until the admin sets the status for a feature to **Hidden** or **Shown**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a feature is available in multiple Office apps, setting the feature to hidden hides the feature announcement in all of the Office apps.
