# Test and deploy Microsoft 365 Apps by partners in the Integrated apps portal

The Microsoft 365 admin center gives you the flexibility to deploy single store apps, custom business line of apps and  Microsoft 365 partner apps from a single location. The location can be accessed at Microsoft Admin center > Settings > Integrated apps. The ability to find, test, and fully deploy purchased and licensed apps by Microsoft partners from the Integrated apps portal provides the convenience and benefits your organization requires to keep business services updated regularly and running efficiently.

For additional information about purchasing and licensing Microsoft 365 apps from partners for your organization, see [Manage and deploy Microsoft 365 Apps from the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/manage-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps-from-the-microsoft-365/ba-p/1194324).
