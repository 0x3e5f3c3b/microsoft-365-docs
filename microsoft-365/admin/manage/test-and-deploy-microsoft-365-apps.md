# Test and deploy Microsoft 365 apps in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Microsoft 365 Apps give you the flexibility to deploy third-party partner apps from a single location in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The ability to find, test, and deploy purchased and licensed apps for Microsoft 365 from the Integrated apps portal provides the convenience and benefits your organization requires to keep business services updated regularly and running efficiently.  

For additional information about purchasing and licensing Microsoft 365 apps for your organization, see the blog post called [Manage and deploy Microsoft 365 Apps from the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/manage-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps-from-the-microsoft-365/ba-p/1194324).
  
## Manage apps in the Integrated apps list

By choosing Integrated apps in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can test or fully deploy all of your organization's apps directly from the Integrated apps list of purchased and licensed apps.

1. In the admin center, in the left nav, choose **Settings**, and then choose **Integrated apps**. 

2. Select an app with **Status** of **More apps available**.

3. Choose **Deploy** next to the message at the top of the page that refers to waiting to be deployed.

4. Review the app you’ve selected, and then select **Deploy**. 

5. Choose **Accept Permissions** for the app(s) you want to deploy, and then select **Deploy**.

6. Choose **Accept** to give permission for the app to access all of the Microsoft 365 resources in the list.

7. Review the permissions you accepted, and then select **Deploy**.  

Review the details for your deployment on the confirmation page. 

## Find published apps to test or deploy 

You can find, test, and deploy published apps that do not already appear in your organization's Integrated apps list. By purchasing and licensing the apps from the admin center, you can add them to your list of deployed apps.

1. In the admin center, in the left nav, choose **Settings**, and then choose **Integrated apps**. 

2. Select **Get apps** above the list.

3. On the published apps page, select the app you want to deploy by choosing **Get it now**.

4. Accept the permissions, and then choose **Continue**.

5. Select **Edit** if you want to deploy only select apps to your organization, or select **Deploy all apps**. 

6. Choose **Full deployment**, and then choose **Next**. 

You can also choose **Test deployment** if you're not ready to deploy to your entire organization.

7. Select **Entire organization** or **Specific users/groups**, and then select **Next**. 

Specific users/groups can be a Microsoft 365 group, a security group, or a distributed group.

8. Read and choose **Accept Permissions**, and select your account to continue deployment. 

7. Choose **Accept** to accept permissions for each app. 

8. Review the permissions you’ve accepted, and then choose **Next**. 

9. Review a summary of the apps and users you've chosen.

10. Review the **Full deployment initiated successfully** confirmation page, and then choose **Done**. 

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, each deployed app **Status** is **OK** with a **Deployment Type** of **Deployed** and the date you deployed the app.
