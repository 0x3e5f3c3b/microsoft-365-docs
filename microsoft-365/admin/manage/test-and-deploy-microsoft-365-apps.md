# Test and deploy Microsoft 365 apps in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft 365 admin center gives you the flexibility to deploy Microsoft and Microsoft partner apps from a single location. The ability to find, test, and fully deploy purchased and licensed apps by Microsoft and Microsoft partners from the Integrated apps portal provides the convenience and benefits your organization requires to keep business services updated regularly and running efficiently.  

For additional information about purchasing and licensing Microsoft 365 apps for your organization, see the blog post called [Manage and deploy Microsoft 365 Apps from the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/manage-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps-from-the-microsoft-365/ba-p/1194324).
  
## Manage apps in the Integrated apps portal

2. Select **Get apps** above the list.

6. Choose **Full deployment**, and then choose **Next**. 

>>You can also choose **Test deployment** if you're not ready to deploy to your entire organization.

7. Select **Entire organization** or **Specific users/groups**, and then select **Next**. 

>>Specific users/groups can be a Microsoft 365 group, a security group, or a distributed group.

8. Read and accept the terms of use, and select your account to continue deployment. 

7. Choose **Accept** to accept permissions for each app. 

8. Review the permissions you’ve accepted, and then choose **Next**. 

9. Review a summary of the apps and users you've chosen.

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, each deployed app **Status** is **OK** with a **Deployment Type** of **Test**, **Full**, or **Custom**, and the date you deployed the app.
