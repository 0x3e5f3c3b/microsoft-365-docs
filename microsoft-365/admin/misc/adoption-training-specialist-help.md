# Microsoft 365 help article report

As the admin of a Microsoft 365 organization, you get a report of the Microsoft 365 help articles people in your organization are reading. You can use this information to see which Microsoft 365 product or service your users need the most help using and provide more resources and help. To learn more about adoption and training for users in your organization, see [Microsoft 365 Adoption and Training dashboard](training-specialist.md).
