# Cortana in Office 365

Cortana, your personal productivity assistant, offers AI-powered experiences to save time and focus attention on what matters most. Cortana will help your users increase their personal productivity for their whole day across both work and life. When signed in with valid work or school accounts, users can get cloud-based Cortana assistance services within the Office 365 productivity tools. Cortana in Office 365 meets Office 365's enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises.

As a personal productivity assistant, Cortana is designed to deliver features that safely and securely process and reason over Office 365 data like emails, files, chats, etc., to save time, increase efficiency, and enhance your users' productivity. 

Moving forward, we are focusing Cortana on enterprise productivity.

- Consistent with other Office 365 services, Cortana in Office 365 meets the same enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises as reflected in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products).

- New cloud-based Cortana assistance services, such as the Briefing email and Play My Emails, will be enabled using Cortana in Office 365 and fully comply with those promises. These features are currently available in the English (United States) market for users with mailboxes in the US geo, and for employees of multi-national corporations with US-based mailboxes.

- Users may connect to Cortana in Office 365 services described here through client applications, such as Outlook Mobile, subject to separate licensing terms.

- Existing consumer experiences, including Cortana in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android, are governed by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). These terms will also govern Cortana in Office 365 services provided to the user when signed in with their consumer credentials.

## What data is processed by Cortana in Office 365?

Cortana in Office 365 processes queries from the user, Office data needed to fulfill the user's request, and other telemetry generated by Microsoft systems to run the service. The data collected by Cortana in Office 365 includes the text representation of the user's spoken queries (i.e., transcriptions from speech recognition). This text data is Customer Data, and it is managed in accordance with the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products). It is only used to develop and improve machine learning models consistent with the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products).

## What is the governance model for Customer Data in Cortana in Office 365?

Consistent with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services, Cortana in Office 365 is secured and subject to the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products). This includes a set of promises for protection of Customer Data against accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Customer Data is also subject to strict access limitations. Microsoft uses Customer Data only to provide the services agreed upon, and for purposes that are compatible with those services. See the table below for details.

## How does Microsoft store, retain, process, and use Customer Data in Cortana?

## Cortana in Office 365 features

### Play My Emails

Play My Emails (as connected to through Outlook mobile) is a voice-driven, hands-free experience for users to listen to their inbox via the speakers on their phone, headphones, or connected audio device. Users can ask Cortana to read their recent emails aloud, and ask Cortana to take actions such as flag, archive, delete, and skip messages. This feature is especially helpful to catch up on your email while commuting or on the go. When the user talks to Cortana in Play My Emails, the speech audio request goes directly to Cortana in Office 365. A text to speech readout of the user's email is processed inside the Office 365 cloud. During this process, no Office 365 data is processed on the user's mobile device and no new email data is saved. A transcript of spoken commands (i.e. "mark as read," "next," "flag," etc.) may be retained in accordance with the Data Protection Terms in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products).

Cortana will call out when an email is protected and briefly pause before reading the message to give users enough time to pause playback or skip to the next message. Similar to a private phone call, users should exercise caution when initiating playback in locations where confidential information could potentially be overheard. In these instances, it's recommended that employees of your organization wear headphones in appropriate environments when using Play My Emails in Outlook mobile.

### Opt out of Play My Emails

Individuals can opt out of Play My Emails using the following steps.

1. Open Outlook mobile.

2. Go to **Settings**.
  
3. Select **Play My Emails**.

4. Move the toggle to off on the accounts you want to disable.

### Briefing email

Cortana sends a personalized briefing email with tasks and commitments you made with a convenient way to mark them as **Done** or schedule focus time to get them done. It also includes a summary of your meetings and relevant documents for your day. Cortana extracts information from a user's Office 365 messages and stores it in their Office 365 mailbox until it's consolidated into Briefing email. At no time is personal data accessible outside of your Office 365 mailbox.

### How to opt out of Briefing email

Admins can configure Briefing for their organization using a [toggle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/briefing/be-admin) in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Individuals can opt out of Cortana's Briefing email by selecting Unsubscribe in the footer of the message.

We'll continue to introduce more Cortana in Office 365 features to help increase your organization's productivity.

## How is Cortana in Office 365 different from other Cortana features I may have previously experienced?

Here are the two ways to think of how Cortana works in your enterprise:

**New experiences for organizations with Cortana in Office 365**: Cortana in Office 365 services are designed to meet the security and compliance needs of organizations.

1. This is a new service and is discussed here in this document.

2. For services subject to the Online Services Terms, Microsoft is a data processor: Microsoft collects and uses Customer Data from customers only to provide the online services requested by our customers and for the purposes instructed by our customers. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the customer is the data controller of their data. See the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Introducing more privacy transparency for our commercial cloud customers](https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2019/11/18/introducing-privacy-transparency-commercial-cloud-customers/).

3. As an example, Play My Emails is a Cortana service that your users can connect to through Outlook for iOS and utilizes Cortana in Office 365.

4. Admins will always have controls for optional connected experiences for Cortana, similar to optional connected experiences while using Office ProPlus applications.

**Existing services for consumers**: Cortana optional connected services are designed primarily for consumer experiences and are currently delivered in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android.

1. These experiences enable features such as weather, news, and traffic.

2. Tenant admins can control whether Cortana in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android are able to allow Cortana to connect to Office 365 tenant data.

Turn off Cortana access to your organization's Microsoft hosted data

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** > **Services** and select **Cortana**.

2. Unselect the checkbox for **Allow these Cortana optional connected experiences to use your organization's Microsoft hosted data** to disable Cortana connected experiences.

3. Select **Save changes**.

For services governed by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2109174) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), Microsoft is the data controller. As the data controller, Microsoft uses data to improve products and services in accordance with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
