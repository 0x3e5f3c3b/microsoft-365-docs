# Cortana in Office 365

Cortana, your personal productivity assistant, is becoming a part of Office 365, offering new transformational AI-powered experiences to save time and focus attention on what matters most.

Cortana will help your users increase their personal productivity for their whole day across both work and life. When signed in with valid work credentials, users can get cloud-based Cortana assistance services within the Office 365 productivity tools. Cortana in Office 365 meets Office 365's enterprise-level privacy, security and compliance promises. These promises will not extend to users signed in with their consumer credentials.

As a personal productivity assistant, Cortana is designed to deliver features that safely and securely process and reason over your organization's data generated by use of other Office 365 services ("O365 data") like emails, files, chats, etc., to save time, increase efficiency, and enhance your users' productivity.

To meet the needs of your organization and deliver on our commitment to protecting your data, Microsoft is making significant updates to its Cortana services.

- First, consistent with other Office 365 services, Cortana's core backend platform meets enterprise-level privacy, security and compliance promises as reflected in the Online Services Terms (OST). Going forward, all new Cortana services will be enabled using the core platform.

- As part of this go-forward plan, new cloud-based Cortana assistance services, such as the Briefing email and Play My Emails, will be enabled using the core platform and fully comply with those promises. These features are currently available in the en-US market for users with mailboxes in the US geo, and for employees of Multi-National Corporations with US-based mailboxes.

- Existing consumer features, such as weather, news, and traffic, and certain new Cortana assistance features, such as the integration of Bing Answers from the public Web, will be governed instead by the Microsoft Services Agreement and Microsoft Privacy Statement. These features are optional connected experiences (see section below). These terms will also govern Cortana assistance services provided to the user when signed in with their consumer credentials. You may disable access to Office 365 data for these services using the Cortana toggle available in the Microsoft 365 IT admin center.

Initially, users will be able to connect to these Cortana services through mobile app endpoints for Outlook mobile or Teams mobile, or via the Cortana app in Windows. These apps are subject to separate terms and controls, in addition to the terms described above.

## Cortana in Office 365 frequently asked questions

**How is Cortana in Office 365 different from other Cortana experiences I may have used?**
Cortana has shifted its focus to enhancing productivity scenarios in Microsoft 365, and as such it is now backed by Cortana in Office 365 services that comply with the Online Services Terms.

Here are the two ways to think of how Cortana works in your enterprise:

1. New experiences for organizations with Cortana in Office 365: Cortana in Office 365 services are designed to meet the security and compliance needs of organizations: 
a.    This is a new service and is discussed here in this document. 
b.    For services subject to the OST, Microsoft is a data processor: Microsoft collects and uses Customer Data from customers only to provide the online services requested by our customers and for the purposes instructed by our customers. Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the customer is the data controller of their data. See the Online Services Terms and Introducing more privacy transparency for our commercial cloud customers. 
c.    As an example, Play My Emails is a feature of Outlook for iOS and utilizes the Office 365 compliant service. (See below for more information about this feature.)

2. Existing services for consumers: Cortana optional connected services are designed primarily for consumer experiences and are currently delivered in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android.
a.    These experiences enable features such as weather, news, and traffic. 
b.    Tenant admins can control whether Cortana in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier)  and the Cortana app on iOS and Android are able to connect to Office 365 services by setting the toggle in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (Settings > Services & add ins > Cortana > Let people in your organization use Cortana).
c.    For services governed by the Microsoft Services Agreement and Microsoft Privacy Statement, Microsoft is the data controller. As the data controller, Microsoft uses data to improve products and services in accordance with the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

Tenant administrators will always have controls for optional connected experiences for Cortana, similar to optional connected experiences while using Office ProPlus applications.

**What data is collected and used by Cortana in Office 365?**
The data collected by Cortana in Office 365 includes the text representation of the user's spoken queries (i.e., transcriptions from speech recognition) and other non-EUII telemetry generated by Microsoft systems used to fulfill Cortana experiences, which is all in accordance with the Online Services Terms. The text data is only used to develop and improve machine learning models and cannot be viewed by a human.

**What is the data governance model?**
Consistent with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services, Cortana in Office 365 is secured and subject to the Online Services Terms. This includes a set of promises for protection of Customer Data against accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Customer Data is also subject to strict access limitations. Microsoft uses Customer Data only to provide the services agreed upon, and for purposes that are compatible with those services. See the table below for details.

**How is the data controlled, accessed, managed, and retained?**
The table below describes the data handling for Cortana in Office 365. Please see the Data Protection Terms and Introducing more privacy transparency for our commercial cloud customers for the latest OST updates which expand our data protection responsibilities.

## New Cortana features

Play My Emails in Outlook mobile is a voice-driven, hands-free experience for users to listen to their inbox via the speakers on their phone, headphones, or connected audio device. Users can ask Cortana to read their recent emails aloud, and ask Cortana to take actions such as flag, archive, delete, and skip messages. This feature is especially helpful to catch up on your email while commuting or on the go. When the user talks to Cortana in Play My Emails in Outlook mobile, the speech audio request goes directly to Cortana in Office 365. A text to speech readout of the user's email is processed inside the Office 365 cloud. During this process, no Office 365 data is processed on the user's mobile device and no new email data is saved. A transcript of spoken commands (i.e. "mark as read," "next," "flag," etc.) may be retained in accordance with the Data Protection Terms in the Microsoft Online Services Terms.

Cortana will call out when an email is protected and briefly pause before reading the message to give users enough time to pause playback or skip to the next message. Similar to a private phone call, users should exercise caution when initiating playback in locations where confidential information could potentially be overheard. In these instances, it's recommended that employees of your organization wear headphones in appropriate environments when using Play My Emails in Outlook mobile. Users can opt out of Play my emails using the following steps:

1. Open Outlook mobile.

2. Go to **Settings**.
  
3. Select **Play My Emails**.

4. Move the toggle to off on the accounts you want to disable.

### Briefing email

Cortana sends a personalized briefing email with tasks and commitments you made with a convenient way to mark them as "done" or schedule focus time to get them done. It also includes a summary of your meetings and relevant documents for your day. Cortana extracts information from a user's Office 365 messages and stores it in their Office 365 mailbox until it's consolidated into Briefing. At no time is personal data accessible outside of your Office 365 mailbox.

### How to opt of Briefing

Admins can configure Briefing for their organization using a toggle in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Individuals can opt out of Cortana's Briefing email by selecting Unsubscribe in the footer of the message. Learn more about Microsoft Compliance offerings.

Compliance is a commitment that Microsoft makes to enterprise customers. [Learn more about the Microsoft compliance framework.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2109173)

Consistent with other Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services, compliant Cortana features are protected and secured subject to the Online Service Terms that includes a set of promises involving protection of user data against accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. All other Cortana features (i.e., Cortana optional connected services) are subject to the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2109174) and  [Microsoft Privacy Statement.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2109175)

Cortana services are broken into two data categories, **compliant** and **optional connected services**, which you can control.

## Cortana optional connected services

Cortana's core platform will back most Cortana features. For the small set of features that must gather data from outside your organization's boundary for things such as weather, news, or traffic, a toggle in the Microsoft 365 admin center will enable you to turn off these optional connected experiences for your organization. For more details, please see the sections about new Cortana features at the bottom of this document.

The admin center toggle will block access to Office 365 data for all Cortana optional connected experiences across endpoints for all employees at your organization.

To turn off Cortana's access to your organization's data for all Cortana optional connected experiences:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** > **Settings** and select **Cortana**.

2. Select the checkbox for **Allow Cortana optional connected experiences to use your organizations's Microsoft hosted data** to disable Cortana connected experiences.

3. Select **Save changes**.
