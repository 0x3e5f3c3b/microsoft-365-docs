# Learn about Microsoft feedback for your organization

User feedback is a critical signal for Microsoft to understand user experiences with Microsoft products. Microsoft values our users’ opinions. User feedback goes directly to our engineers and helps us shape the future of Microsoft products and services for all our users.  
In this topic, you'll find information on what types of feedback exist, how we collect it, what we collect and how we handle the data.

## Feedback types

### In-app feedback

If your users are using one of Microsoft's apps and wish to provide feedback, there are various ways to do that from within the apps they're using. Users can use these different ways to share product and feature feedback with us. One of the most common ways to share feedback through Microsoft apps is under the Help menu. Selecting **Help** > **Feedback** from most Microsoft apps launches a feedback page, which allows users to submit feedback to Microsoft.

### In-product surveys

Users can also rate their experience and provide additional information about their experience via Microsoft initiated surveys. These surveys appear in the Microsoft 365 apps occasionally, at the bottom right of the app. If the user decides to provide feedback, dismisses the survey, or lets the survey disappear on its own, that user won't see the survey again for a while. Microsoft uses a data governance process to suppress these surveys to ensure the least amount disruption to your users.

## What kind of feedback is best?

Detailed and actionable feedback is vital for making changes and improvements in Microsoft products. If your users have issues, or have a great suggestion for how we can improve, we’d like to hear it. Below are a few tips and examples on actionable feedback sent to Microsoft.

- **Concise and descriptive title**   Descriptive and specific titles help us understand the issue being reported. Example: Excel’s **Recent files** list doesn't include recently added OneDrive files.
- **Focus on one issue at a time**   Provide feedback for one issue or recommendation one item at a time. This ensures the correct logs and data are received with each submission and can be assigned for follow up. If you have more than one issue, submit a new feedback request for each issue. This helps us identify the volume of feedback we’re receiving on a particular issue.
- **Write details in the Description box**   Information about your device, operating system, and apps are automatically included in each reported feedback. Add additional about an issue you think is important. For example, include detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

## How Microsoft uses feedback

Microsoft uses feedback to improve Microsoft products. We get a lot of user feedback in the form of questions, problems, compliments, and suggestions. We make sure this feedback makes it back to the appropriate teams, who use feedback to identify, prioritize and make improvements to Microsoft products. Feedback is essential for our product teams to understand our user's experiences, and directly influences the priority of fixes and improvements.
