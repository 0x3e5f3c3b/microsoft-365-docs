# Manage Microsoft feedback for your organization

User feedback is a critical signal for Microsoft  to understand their users’ experiences with Microsoft products. Microsoft values users’ opinions. User feedback goes directly to our engineers and helps us shape the future of Microsoft products and services for all our users.  
Below you will find information on what types of feedback exist, how we collect it, what we collect and how we handle the data and why it is valuable to Microsoft.

## Feedback types

### In-app feedback

If users are using one of Microsoft's applications and wish to provide us feedback, there are various ways to do that from within the application. Users can use these mechanisms to share product and feature experiences with us. One of the most common places to find this mechanism in the application is under the Help menu. Clicking Help -> Feedback will launch this experience and allow users to submit their feedback to Microsoft.

### In-product surveys

Users can also rate their experience and provide additional information about their experience via system-initiated survey prompts. These prompts occur within the Microsoft 365 products from time to time. When prompted, users can choose if they want to provide feedback. The survey prompt typically appears at the bottom right of the application. If the user decides to provide feedback, dismisses the prompt, or lets the prompt disappear on its own, that user will not see the survey again for some period of time.   Microsoft leverages a governance process to suppress these system-initiated surveys to ensure the least amount of user disruption.

## What kind of feedback is best?

Detailed and actionable feedback is vital for making changes and improvements in Microsoft applications. If you find a bug, have an issue, or have a great suggestion for how we can improve we’d like to hear it. Here are a few tips that will help us share your feedback with the right people and drive it to resolution.
•	Use a concise and descriptive title
Descriptive and specific titles help Office engineers understand the issue being reported. An example of a good title: “Excel’s ‘recent files’ list does not include recently added OneDrive files.”
•	Focus on one issue at a time
Providing feedback one item at a time ensures the correct logs and data are received with each submission and can be assigned to someone for follow up. If you have more than one issue, please submit a new feedback request for each. This also helps us identify the volume of feedback we’re receiving on a particular issue.
•	Write details in the Description box
Information about your device, operating system, and apps are automatically included in each reported feedback. But whatever additional info you can provide about an issue would be appreciated. For example, include detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

## How Microsoft uses feedback

Microsoft leverages user feedback to continuously improve Microsoft products. We get a lot of user feedback in the form of questions, problems, compliments, and suggestions. We ensure that this feedback makes it back to product teams, who then use this feedback to identify, prioritize and make improvements to their products. Your feedback is essential for our product teams to understand your experiences, and directly influences the priority of fixes and improvements.

### What do we collect?

We want to understand the users’ experience and satisfaction with their user of Microsoft products. During feedback submission, application information is typically collected alongside the supplied ratings and feedback descriptions.  Additionally, if you have    enabled the policy, we may also  collect screenshots and logs to help us debug and resolve problems the user may be running into.
