# Getting a mailbox not found error in Outlook on the web?

If you're using Outlook on the web and you get a  **Mailbox couldn't be found for**  error, the account that you used to connect to Outlook on the web doesn't have an Exchange Online license and therefore, no mailbox is associated with the account. Your admin can assign a license to your account by following these steps:

1. Open the  [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage)  and go to  **Active users**  under the  **Users**  section, and select the user who is seeing the error.
2. In the user page that opens, go to the  **Licenses and Apps**  section, select the appropriate  **Location**  value, and assign a license that contains Exchange Online (expand the license to see its details). When you're finished, click  **Save changes**.
