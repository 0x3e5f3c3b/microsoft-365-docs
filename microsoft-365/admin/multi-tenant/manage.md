# Multi-tenant management

Multi-tenant management offers a unified form of management that allows admins the ability to administer all the tenants they manage from a single location. If you manage multiple tenants, you can:

- Move quickly between tenants you manage.
- Assess service health, products, and billing across multiple tenants.
- On the **All tenants** page, you can quickly see the health of all your tenants' services, any open service requests, your products and billing, and the number of users in that tenant.


## Move between tenants

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select the org name.

## View All tenants page

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left nav, select **All tenants**.
- On the **All tenants** page, you can
  - Assess service health
  - Review license usage
  - Search for, or select the tenant you want to manage
  - You can also pin your most often visited tenant to the top of the list.


If you've marked a tenant as a favorite, it's automatically expanded so you can immediately view the status details.

## View service health for all accounts

The service health view shows you if any incidents or advisories are affecting the tenants. It will even tell you how many of your managed tenants are affected.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the multi-tenant view, select **Service Health**.
2. On the **Service health** page, you can review issues under **All services** or **All issues** tabs.
3. Select an incident on the **All services** or **All issues** tab to get more information about any incident on the **Overview** tab. Select the **Tenants affected** tab to get a list of the affected tenants.

## View a single tenant in the Microsoft 365 admin center

You can return to the Microsoft 365 admin center for any of the tenants from the **All tenants** page.

1. On the **All tenants** page, click on the tenant name for which you want to view the admin center.
2. You are directed to the admin center for that tenant.
