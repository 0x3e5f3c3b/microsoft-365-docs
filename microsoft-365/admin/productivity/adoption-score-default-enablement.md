# Microsoft Adoption Score default enablement

[Adoption Score](productivity-score.md) is currently disabled by default in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and admins must proactively enable it before insights are displayed. 

**Starting in June 2022, Adoption Score will be enabled by default**, meaning that insights will automatically be displayed in the Admin Center without an admin needing to explicitly enable them. 

Prior to June 2022, admins have the ability to suppress this default enablement update and choose instead to keep it disabled. This article explains the process by which this update will be rolled out. 


> [!NOTE]
> Adoption Score is currently unavailable for US Government tenants, and this update will not impact this stance. This update also will not have any impact on tenants that currently have Adoption Score enabled and tenants that enabled but subsequently disabled People Experiences insights.

## Choose your default enablement setting

Starting on **April 28th 2022**, admins that visit the Adoption Score page in the Microsoft 365 admin center will see the following page:<br/>

[Select Adoption Score preferences message.](../../media/adoption-score-will-be-turned-on.png)<br/>


After selecting **Select Adoption Score preferences**, you will see the following settings panel:<br/>

[Adoption Score preferences.](../../media/adoption-score-enablement-settings.png)<br/>


Admins have the following options on this page: 

- **Turn on Adoption Score now**. If admins choose this option and select **Save**, Adoption Score insights will be enabled immediately. Admins will be able to access their tenant’s insights within 24 hours. <br/>
- **Do not enable in June 2022**. If admins choose this option and select **Save**, they will see the following screen confirming that Adoption Score will not be enabled in June 2022: <br/>

    [Select Adoption Score preferences message.](../../media/adoption-score-not-turned-on.png)<br/>

    When the default enablement rollout is completed in June 2022, tenants that selected this option will not have any Adoption Score insights enabled, and will instead see the following message: <br/>

    [Select Adoption Score preferences message.](../../media/turn-on-adoption-score.png)<br/>

- **Take no action** If admins don’t select **Save** (or don’t visit this page at all), then Adoption Score will be enabled in June 2022. The specific rollout date will vary by tenant and may take place at any point during the month of June 2022. Microsoft will provide more details on timing through the Microsoft 365 Admin Message Center. <br/>
