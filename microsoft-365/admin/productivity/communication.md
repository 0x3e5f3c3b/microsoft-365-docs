# Communication – Employee experience

Productivity Score helps organizations transform how work gets done with insights about how people use Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support them. The score reflects your organization's performance against employee and technology experience measures and compares your score with organizations like yours. The Communication data is part of the Employee experience measures. Check out the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md).

## Why your org's Communication score matters

Microsoft understands that people have different communication needs. To get a quick response to a question, you might choose to send an instant message. If you want to send status updates to your leadership, you may choose an email message. To reach a broader audience, you may choose to post a community message. Microsoft 365 enables this flexibility in communication modes to fit everyone's needs. Research shows that using real-time communication tools creates a more unified organization and builds employee morale, regardless of location. [See the evidence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2127669).

We measure how frequently people use email, chat, and community posts to help you understand how people in your organization find and share information.

## How we calculate the score

For Communication, we provide a primary insight, which contains the key metrics associated with communication in your org, combined with a scoring model for using these metrics to calculate your score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft 365 provides people the flexibility to fit everyone's communication style by offering multiple modes. The primary insight provides a measure of people in your org that are using multiple modes to communicate.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/primaryinsight.png" alt-text="Primary insight to communications modes.":::

1. **Header:** Provides the key metric of people using more than one of communication modes, namely
      1. Sending emails through Exchange
      2. Sending messages through Teams
      3. Posting on communities in Yammer

as a percentage of all people who are enabled for more than one of these products – Exchange, Teams and Yammer.

2. **Body:** Provides more information on how flexibility in the modes of communication is valuable to people in your org
3. **Visualization of current state:**
1. Horizontal bar where the blue portion represents the percentage expressed in the header
2. Highlights the (numerator/denominator) used for computing the percentage expressed in the header

      - **Numerator**: # of people using more than one communication modes in the last 28 days
      - **Denominator**: # of people marked as enabled for more than one communication products in the last 28 days
6. **Peer Benchmark** value of the key metric is also shown as a percentage

- **Link to resources:** Clicking here would enlist all the support content in the form of videos/articles related to Communication. From these you can navigate to the custom playlist for Communication and subsequently, for all Productivity Score categories.
- **Visualization of trend:** This chart provides the trend of numerator of the key metric in the primary insight – that is, the number of people using more than one communication modes over the last 180 days. Here that the daily value is an aggregate of the number of people who use multiple forms of communication over the last 28 days.

### Scoring model

The score is computed based on the frequency of communicating using multiple modes over a 28-day window.

## Explore how your organization communicates

We also provide you with information that help you gain visibility into how people in your organization communicate. These additional metrics don't directly influence your Productivity Score, but can help you optimize the way people in your organization communicate.
