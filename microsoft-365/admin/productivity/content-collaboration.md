# Content collaboration â€“ People experiences

Productivity Score helps you transform how work gets done with metrics about how people use Microsoft 365 apps and the technology experiences that support them. The score reflects your organization&#39;s performance for people and technology experiences and compares your score with organizations like yours. Content collaboration is one of the measures that falls under people experiences. Check out the  [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md).

## Why your organization&#39;s content collaboration score matters

A fundamental pillar for organizational productivity is how people collaborate in files. With your content on Microsoft 365, people access, create, modify, and collaborate on content with other people from any location. Research shows that when people collaborate with online files, each person saves an average of 100 minutes per week. See the [evidence](https://vc2prod.blob.core.windows.net/vc-resources/TEIStudies/TEI%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20E5%20-%20Oct%202018.pdf).

## How we calculate the content collaboration score

We provide a primary insight that contains the key metrics for content collaboration. Then, a scoring framework detailed below is used for these metrics to calculate your score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft OneDrive for Business and SharePoint enable people to easily create, read, and discover their individual and shared content in Microsoft 365 from across devices and applications. They also allow people to securely share and collaborate on content. The primary insight contains information from everyone who can use OneDrive for Business and SharePoint. Additionally it breaks down the details about how many people read, create, and collaborate on content stored in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/collabscore_primary.jpg" alt-text="Primary insights from communication collaboration score.":::


Types considered for this information include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and PDF files.

1. **Header:** Shows the percentage of people who have access to OneDrive or SharePoint who are collaborating on content.
2. **Body:** Provides more information on how the behaviors of reading and creating files online are linked to collaborating on files.
3. **Visualization (current state):**
    - Horizontal bars where the blue-colored portions represent the percentage of people enabled for file collaboration through OneDrive or SharePoint who are **readers, creators,** or **collaborators** on online files in the last 28 days.

        They're defined as follows:</br>
        **Readers:** People who access or download online files in OneDrive or SharePoint.</br>
        **Creators:** People who create, modify, upload, sync, check in, copy, or move online OneDrive or SharePoint files.</br>
        **Collaborators:** People who collaborate with online files using OneDrive or SharePoint. Two people are collaborators if one of them reads or edits an online Office app or PDF after the other person has created or modified it, within a 28-day window.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The files considered in the visualization are Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or PDF files that are online and saved to OneDrive or SharePoint. 

    - Highlight the (numerator/denominator) of the fraction used to calculate the percentage expressed in each of the horizontal bars.
    
      - **Readers:**</br>
          - Numerator: Number of people who access or download online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
          - Denominator: Number of people who have access to OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days</br>
      - **Creators:**</br>
        - Numerator: Number of people who create, modify, upload, sync, check in, copy, or move online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
        - Denominator: Number of people who have had access to OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days. </br> 
      - **Collaborators:**</br>
        - Numerator: Number of people who have collaborated on online files in OneDrive or SharePoint in the last 28 days</br>
        - Denominator: Number of people who have had access to for OneDrive or SharePoint for at least 1 of the last 28 days

    - Peer Benchmark value for each of readers, creators, and collaborators is also shown as a percentage. In other words, the value of the number of creators is shown as a percentage of the number of people who have access to OneDrive or SharePoint.

#### Trend visualization of primary insight

Trend visualizations chart shows the trend-line of the primary insight key metrics for readers, creators, and collaborators, over the last 180 days. Each data point on the chart is an aggregate of activity for the last 28 days. Each creator data-point provides a count of all people who were tagged as creators within the last 28 days for each date on the x axis.

### Scoring framework

The content collaboration score measures whether people are consistently reading, creating, or collaborating on online Office files, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or PDF, in OneDrive or SharePoint.

## Explore how your organization collaborates

We also provide you with information that helps you gain visibility into how people in your organization collaborate on content. These additional metrics don't directly contribute to your Productivity Score but help you create an action plan to optimize the way people work.
