# Meetings â€“ People experiences

Productivity Score helps organizations transform how work gets done with metrics about how people use Microsoft 365 apps and the supporting technology experiences. The score reflects your organization&#39;s performance for people and technology experiences and compares your score with organizations like yours. The meetings category is one of the measures within people experiences. To learn more, check out the [Productivity Score overview](productivity-score.md).

## Why your organizations meetings score matters

Meetings, where people explore ideas, plan, solve problems, and make decisions, are a fundamental pillar for organizational productivity. Research indicates that when people use online meeting tools effectively, they tend to save up to 104 minutes per week. See the [evidence](https://vc2prod.blob.core.windows.net/vc-resources/TEIStudies/TEI%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20E5%20-%20Oct%202018.pdf).

## How we calculate the score

We provide a primary insight in the experience that contains the key metrics for this category. Then, a scoring framework, detailed below, is used for these metrics to calculate your score.

### Primary insight

Microsoft Teams integrate with Outlook calendar and provide a host of capabilities to make your meetings more engaging and effective. The primary insight looks at all Microsoft Teams online meetings that were held in your organization. The Primary insight also tracks how many meetings follow at least one of the best practices for Teams meetings.
