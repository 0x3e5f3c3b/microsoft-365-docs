# Microsoft Productivity Score 

Productivity Score helps organizations transform how work gets done with insights about how people use Microsoft 365 and the technology experiences that support them. The score reflects your organization’s performance against people and technology experiences measures and compares your score with organizations like yours.

The score includes:

- **Metrics** to help you see how people are using Microsoft 365 products to collaborate, communicate, and work across platforms.
- **Insights** about the data to help you identify opportunities to improve employee productivity and satisfaction.
- **Recommended actions** you can take to help the people in your organization use Microsoft 365 products efficiently so everyone can do their best work.

We provide data, insights, and recommendations in two areas: 

- **People experiences:** Measures how people collaborate on content, how they use Microsoft 365 products to communicate, and whether they use Microsoft 365 across multiple platforms. 

    We provide these insights because when people collaborate online, they save time, and with the freedom to work on any device makes then more productive and satisfied. The ability to communicate in a flexible way makes people more efficient, able to form better relationships therefore making your organization more unified. For evidence, see [Forrester report](https://vc2prod.blob.core.windows.net/vc-resources/TEIStudies/TEI%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20E5%20-%20Oct%202018.pdf).

- **Technology experiences:** Productivity depends on reliable and well performing technology as well as the efficient use of Microsoft 365. We provide [endpoint analytics](https://aka.ms/endpointanalytics), which helps you understand how your users’ productivity can be impacted by performance and health issues with your endpoint hardware and software. We also provide recommended actions to remediate them as well as Microsoft 365 network connectivity insights for your organization.

See [What is Endpoint Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/analytics/overview) for an overview and prerequisite details. To learn more about Microsoft 365 network connectivity insights, read [the network connectivity overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-networking-overview).
  

## How the score is calculated

Your Productivity Score is based on the combined scores of your people and technology experiences categories. Each category is weighted equally, with a total of 100 points. The highest possible Productivity Score is 500.

### Score categories 

- Communication (100 points)
- Meetings (100 points)
- Content collaboration (100 points)
- Teamwork (100 points)
- Mobility (100 points)
- Endpoint analytics (100 points)
- Network connectivity (100 points)
- Microsoft 365 Apps Health (100 points)
- **Total possible = 800 points**
 
 In each category, we identify patterns for key activities that are indicators for how people use Microsoft 365 products to collaborate, communicate, and work across platforms. We provide 28-day and 180-day views of the key activities. We also provide supporting metrics that are not part of the score calculation but are important for helping you identify underlying behaviors and settings that you can act on.

**Your score** is shown as a percent value and in points. You can see your points in the numerator and the maximum possible points in the denominator.

**Peer benchmarks** allow you to compare your score with organizations like yours. For the people experiences categories, the peer benchmark measure is calculated as the average of measures within a set of similar organizations. The set is composed of organizations in your region with a similar number of licensed users, types of licenses, industry, and tenure with Microsoft 365. 

The endpoint analytics peer benchmark includes targets for device startup performance and recommended software configuration based on aggregated median values across all tenants.

For network connectivity, the recommended benchmark is 80 points.
