# Top 10 ways to secure your business data - Best practices for small and medium-sized businesses

If you are a small or medium-size business and you have one of the Microsoft 365 for business plans, you can use the guidance in this article to secure your business data. 

## Top 10 ways to secure your business data

| Number | What to do | 
|:---|:---|
| 1 | **[Use multi-factor authentication](#set-up-multi-factor-authentication.md)** (MFA). MFA is also called 2-step verification. It requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365. This extra step can prevent hackers from taking over if they know your password. <br/><br/>To set up MFA, you can use either security defaults (suitable for most businesses) or Conditional Access (for more stringent security requirements). To learn more, see the following articles: <br/>- [Security defaults and multi-factor authentication](../../business-premium/m365bp-conditional-access.md)<br/>- [Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft 365](multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) |
| 2 | **[Protect your administrator accounts](../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md)**. Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts susceptible to cyberattacks. To protect your admin accounts, see [Protect your administrator accounts](../../business-premium/m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md).  |
| 3 | **[Use preset security policies](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#review-and-apply-preset-security-policies)**. Your subscription includes [preset security policies](../../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md) that use recommended settings for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing protection. By default, built-in protection is enabled; however, consider applying standard or strict protection for increased security. To learn more, see [Protect against malware and other cyberthreats](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md).|
| 4 | **[Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders)**. By default, sharing levels are set to the most permissive level for both SharePoint and OneDrive. We recommend changing the default settings to better protect your business. See [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders). | 
| 5 | **[Manage calendar sharing for your business](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#disable-or-manage-calendar-sharing)**. You can prevent people in your organization from sharing their calendars. You can also manage what level of detail they can share. For example, you can restrict the sharing to free/busy times only. See [Disable or manage calendar sharing](../../business-premium/m365bp-increase-protection.md#disable-or-manage-calendar-sharing).  |
| 6 | **Protect devices** (including unmanaged BYOD and managed devices). Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be monitored and managed properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. To protect devices, see the following articles: <br/>- [Set up MFA on mobile devices](../../business-premium/m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md) |
| 7 | Use Outlook and Office apps on devices |
| 8 | **[Train everyone on email best practices](../../business-premium/m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)**. As you know, email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. Train your people to know how to watch out for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. See [Protect yourself against phishing and other attacks](../../business-premium/m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md).|
| 9 | Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing |
| 10 | Maintain your environment |

All the Microsoft 365 plans offer baseline protection and security with Defender Antivirus, but with Microsoft 365 Business Premium you also have threat protection, data protection, and device management features due to the inclusion of Microsoft Defender for Business.  These additional capabilities protect your organization from online threats and unauthorized access, as well as allow you to manage company data on your phones, tablets, and computers.
