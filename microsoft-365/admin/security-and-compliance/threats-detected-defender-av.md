# Threats detected by Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Microsoft Defender Antivirus protects your Windows devices from software threats, such as viruses, malware, and spyware.

- Viruses typically spread by attaching their code to other files on your device or network, and can cause infected programs to not run correctly.
- Malware includes malicious files, applications, and code that can cause damage and disrupt normal use of devices. In addition, malware can allow unauthorized access, use system resources, steal passwords, lock you out of your computer and ask for ransom, and more.
- Spyware collects data, such as web-browsing activity, and sends the data to remote servers.
 
To provide threat protection, Microsoft Defender Antivirus uses several methods. These methods include cloud-delivered protection, real-time protection, and dedicated protection updates.

- Cloud-delivered protection helps provide near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats.
- Always-on scanning uses file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (this is also known as "real-time protection").
- Dedicated protection updates are based on machine learning, human and automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research.
