- Choose a custom theme
- Add your company logo.
- Change the colors to match the rest of your brand.
- Add a destination link users go when they select your logo.
  
## Customize your theme in the admin center

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Org Settings** page, and then choose the **Organization profile** tab.

2. On the **Organization profile** tab, select **Custom themes** and then **Add custom theme**.

## Logos: Choose your company logo

On the **Logos** page, you can add your logos and decide whether you want your logo to send users to a URL you choose.

- **Default logo**: Add a URL location that points to your logo. Make sure that the URL uses HTTPS and that the image is at least 200 x 30 pixels. Your default logo can be in the JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG format.
- **Alternate logo**: Add a URL location that points to your logo. Your alternate logo should be optimized for use in Office dark themes. Same requirements as the default logo.
- **Small default logo**: Add a URL location that points to your logo. The image must be at least 48 x 48 pixels. You can scale this image so it fits on smaller or mobile devices.
- **Small alternate logo**: Add a URL location that points to your logo. This image has the same requirements as the small default logo.
- **On-click link**: Add a URL location that points to your logo. You can use your logo as a link to any company resource, for example, your company's website.

Select **Save** to save your changes.

You can remove your logos at any time. Just return to the **Logos** page and select **Remove**.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, we first show logo selections that most organizations use. To see all the logo selections, go to the bottom of the list and select **See advanced options**.
  
## Colors: Choose your default colors

On the **Colors** page, you can set the default colors and choose which logo should be used.

- **Navigation bar color**: Select a color to use for the background of the navigation bar. The navigation bar appears at the top on every page.
- **Text and icon color**: Select a color to use for the text and icons on the top navigation bar.
- **Accent color**: Pick one that shows up well on a white or light background. The accent color is used to color some links and buttons that show up on a white or light background. For example, the accent color is used to color elements in a user's inbox and on their Office.com portal page.
- **Reset color**: Select this link to reset colors to the default colors.
- **Which logo should be used?**: Select default logos or any other logos you've created yourself.
