# Download perpetual software and product license keys

We plan to retire the Microsoft Open License program on December 31, 2021. Starting on January 1, 2022, you wonâ€™t be able to renew or buy new perpetual software licenses, Software Assurance, or online services through the Microsoft Open License program. Beginning on January 1, 2021, small and medium-sized business customers can buy perpetual software licenses through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.

> [!NOTE]
> You can continue to renew and buy new perpetual software licenses, Software Assurance, and online services through the existing Microsoft Open License program until December 31, 2021.

The changes to these programs provide a simplified approach to buying perpetual software licenses for your organization. This article explains how to download the software and product license keys for perpetual software that you bought through CSP.
