# Migrate data to my Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription

Follow the steps in this article to move your OneDrive, Outlook and Teams data to your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription.

## Move files to OneDrive for business

This section describes how to move the files stored in your Microsoft 365 personal account to your Microsoft 365 business account. With both OneDrive accounts synced to your device, you can easily drag and drop the files between two OneDrive folders.

1. Select the OneDrive white cloud icon in the Windows notification area and make sure your OneDrive personal account is synced to your device.

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to select the **Show hidden icons** arrow next to the notification area to see the OneDrive icon. If the icon doesn't appear in the notification area, OneDrive might not be running. Select **Start**, type OneDrive in the search box, and then select OneDrive in the search results.

2. To add your new business account, select  **Help & Settings** > **Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't set up OneDrive with your current Microsoft 365 personal account before, follow the steps above to set up your personal account on your device and sync your files before moving to the next steps.

### Drag and drop files in OneDrive

With both your Microsoft 365 personal and business accounts synced to your device, you can now move your files from your personal OneDrive folder to your new business OneDrive folder.

1. In File Explorer, open your synced OneDrive folder that contains your files.

2. Select and drag the files you want from your OneDrive personal folder to your new OneDrive business folder.

### Notes about moving files from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work

- If you’re moving a large number of files, we recommend that you move files in batches of no more than 100 files each.

- Files you move from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work are recognized as new files, and as a result, these files don’t retain metadata details such as Modified and Modified By.

- If you shared files in OneDrive before, you'll need to share these files again in your new OneDrive for work after you move them. Also, once you share these files, we recommend that you delete the original files from OneDrive. This way, people won’t be able to refer to out-of-date copies of files you’d shared with them earlier.

## Step: Set up Outlook for email

1. On the Windows Start menu, search for Outlook, and select it.

    (If you're using a Mac, open Outlook from the toolbar or locate it using the Finder.)

    If you've just installed Outlook, on the Welcome page, select **Next**.

2. Choose **File** \> **Info** \> **Add Account**.

3. Enter your Microsoft email address and select **Connect**.

1. **Export your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export**.

    Select **Export to a File** and then follow the steps to export your Outlook Data File (.pst) and any subfolders.

2. **Import your old email**

    In Outlook, choose **File** \> **Open &amp; Export** \> **Import/Export** again.

    This time, select **Import from another program or file** and follow the steps to import the backup file you created when you exported your old email.
