# Set up my business account in Microsoft 365

You'll get an email notification that looks like this when someone in your organization sets you up with a new Microsoft 365 for business user account. When you get this email, you'll have to complete a few steps before you can start using your new user account.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have your current account sign in details before you start these steps.

## Set up your user account

1. On the admin center home page, select **Create an account for another person**.

2. Add the user details for the person you want to create the account for and select **Send invitation**.

## Simplified view - Accept invitation 

When you set up Microsoft 365 for your business, you can create a custom email address that includes your business name. This makes the address easier to remember, gives you and your employees the same company branded email, and provides more security in the Microsoft Cloud.

## Set up email through Microsoft 365

1. From the Microsoft 365 admin center page, select **Set up email through Microsoft 365**.

2. Choose **Get a new domain for your organization**.

3. On the **Set up email** wizard, read the notes, watch the overview video and select **Continue**.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll have to sign out and back in with your new user account after you add your domain.

4. Choose a domain name for your business and select **Check availability** to make sure you can use it. Select **Continue**.

5. Add contact info for your domain and select **Continue**.

6. Choose a payment method, make the payment and select **Continue**.

7. Review your order and select Place order to complete the purchase of your new domain.

8. Select **Continue** to set up your new work account. Add your new username and new password and select **Sign out**.

9. After you sign out, you can now sign in to Microsoft 365 with your new username and password.

10. Once you're signed in, set up work accounts for your users. Choose their new email address and make sure you add their alternative email address so they can get the email notification with instructions on how to set up their new user account. Select **Continue**.

11. Select **Continue** after you review the notification email, and then **Done** to complete the upgrade.

## Next steps

Follow up with your users to make sure they received the email notification to set up their new account. You can send them the link to the (placeholder) topic if they need help with set up.
