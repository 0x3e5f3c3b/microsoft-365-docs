## Sign up steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can follow these steps to purchase Microsoft 365 Apps as well. For more info, see .

To sign up and purchase Microsoft 365 for your business, complete the following steps:

1. On the [Microsoft 365 for business page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109654), select **See plans & pricing**.
2. On the next page, find out the monthly cost, and then scroll down the page to find out more about what's included in Microsoft 365. Under Microsoft 365 Business Standard, select **Buy now**.
3. On the **Thank you for choosing Microsoft 365 Business Standard** page, enter your information to get started and select **Next**.
4. Enter an email address that you already use. This can be any address you want Microsoft to use to communicate with you during setup. It is also the address where we'll send you information about your bill and renewals. Then select, **Set up account**.
5. Enter your name, business phone number, business size, company name, and location. Your country or region determines the exact services you receive from Microsoft, and can't be changed after you complete this step. Select **Next**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > We display your company name in the admin center; this is where you manage Microsoft 365 users, licenses, and so on. We also include it in any internal (SharePoint) site URLs.
6. Help us make sure this is you. Enter a number that we can reach you and select **Send Verification Code**.

- You'll receive a text. Enter your code and select **Verify**.

7. Decide how you'll sign in to Microsoft 365. You can use your current email address or create a new business email by adding a domain. In this example, we'll select **Next** to sign in with your personal email address.

        - **Sign in with your personal email, for example, alliebellew@hotmail.com.** 
        
            If your email address doesn't include your business name and if you don't have a web site that uses your business name, you can easily buy a domain later. You'll sign into Microsoft 365 with this email address.
        
        - **Create a new business email account (advanced)** 
        
             You want to create a new business account with a website that uses your business name. To do this, you'll need a domain. You can either buy a domain in the next step or add a domain you already own. You'll then sign into Microsoft 365 with this new email address.


        - **I don't own a domain name** 
        
            If your email address doesn't include your business name and if you don't have a web site that uses your business name, you can easily buy a domain in the next step. Select **Buy a new domain name**, and enter the name of your business. For example, if your company is called *ContosoSkis*, try entering Contosokis.com, Contososkis.org, or Contososkis.biz. Then select **Check availability** to see whether your chosen domain is available. You can try multiple options before you make a decision. If your domain name is available, we'll let you know the cost and bill you directly with your new plan. 
       
            > [!TIP]
            > if you're not sure what domain extension to choose for your new domain (for example, .com or .org), see [Buy a domain name](../admin/get-help-with-domains/buy-a-domain-name.md)
        
        - **I'm not sure, or I own a domain name already** 
        
             Choose **Get a Microsoft domain for now**. This doesn't cost anything, and later you can get a custom name for your business, or connect to one you already own. We'll show you how.

8. Then create a password on the next page. Select **Create account** to continue. On the next page, read about how handle your data and select whether you want Microsoft Partners to contact you. Select **Next**.

9. On the next page, select how many Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses you want for your organization and select **Add payment method** and continue with checkout to **Place order**.

10. On the Confirmation details, we'll give you some more info about your subscription. You can now go to the Microsoft 365 admin center to add users, install Office apps, invite your team to use Microsoft 365 and more.
