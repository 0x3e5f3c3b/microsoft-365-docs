# Consumer upgrade of Microsoft 365 for business

When you set up Microsoft 365 for your business, you can create a custom email address that includes your business name. This makes the address easier to remember, gives you and your employees the same company branded email, and provides more security in the Microsoft Cloud.

## Set up email through Microsoft 365

1. From the Microsoft 365 admin center page, select **Set up email through Microsoft 365**.

2. Choose **Get a new domain for your organization**.

3. On the **Set up email** wizard, read the notes, watch the overview video and select **Continue**.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll have to sign out and back in with your new user account after you add your domain.

4. Choose a domain name for your business and select **Check availability** to make sure you can use it. Select **Continue**.

5. Add contact info for your domain and select **Continue**.

6. Choose a payment method, make the payment and select **Continue**.

7. Review your order and select Place order to complete the purchase of your new domain.

8. Select **Continue** to set up your new work account. Add your new username and new password and select **Sign out**.

9. After you sign out, you can now sign in to Microsoft 365 with your new username and password.

10. Once you're signed in, set up work accounts for your users. Choose their new email address and make sure you add their alternative email address so they can get the email notification with instructions on how to set up their new user account. Select **Continue**.

11. Select **Continue** after you review the notification email, and then **Done** to complete the upgrade.

## Next steps

Follow up with your users to make sure they received the email notification to set up their new account. You can send them the link to the (placeholder) topic if they need help with set up.
