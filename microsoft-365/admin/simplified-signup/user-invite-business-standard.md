### Notes about moving files from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work

- If you’re moving a large number of files, we recommend that you move files in batches of no more than 100 files each.

- Files you move from OneDrive personal to OneDrive for work are recognized as new files, and as a result, these files don’t retain metadata details such as Modified and Modified By.

- If you shared files in OneDrive before, you'll need to share these files again in your new OneDrive for work after you move them. Also, once you share these files, we recommend that you delete the original files from OneDrive. This way, people won’t be able to refer to out-of-date copies of files you’d shared with them earlier.

- Another way to move your files from one OneDrive account to another is to use Mover. See this page for more info.
