# Accept an email invitation to a Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription organization using an Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail or other account (User)

When someone adds you to a Microsoft 365 for business organization, you'll get an email invitation with steps on how to join. In this scenario, you're joining an organization that doesn't have a different professional email for users. You'll sign in with your regular email account.

> If you’re an admin and you’re looking for steps on how to send a user an invite to your Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription, check out [Invite users to Microsoft 365 Business Standard (Admin)](admin-invite-business-standard.md).
