### Search in distribution lists to add Priority Accounts

Previously, you could only tag priority accounts by searching for them using the person's name, e-mail address or job title. With this update, you can now search for people to add to priority accounts in a distribution list. This allows you to bulk add people in an efficient way and reduces the time needed to tag individual people in your organization.

:::image type="content" source="../media/search-by-distribution-list-priority-accounts.png" alt-text="Screenshot: Search for priority accounts to add using a distribution list":::

- You can tag up to 50 users from a distribution list as priority accounts in a single action.

- Additional information about the user like department and job title has been introduced on the Priority Accounts page.

- You can only tag user accounts within distribution lists, and not the list itself. Users who have already been tagged won’t show up in your distribution list search.
