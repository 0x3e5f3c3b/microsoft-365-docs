# Microsoft Bookings Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**What is Microsoft Bookings?**

Microsoft Bookings is a Microsoft 365 app that makes scheduling and managing appointments easy. Bookings incudes a Web-based booking calendar and integrates with Outlook to optimize your staff’s calendar, giving your customers flexibility to book a time that works best for them. Automated notification emails reduce no-shows, and organizations save time with a reduction in repetitive scheduling tasks. Bookings helps you easily conduct virtual appointments via Skype or Microsoft Teams, and helps you manage day-to-day scheduling via the Bookings app in Teams. With built-in ability to customize, Bookings is designed to meet the needs of multiple parts of any organization.

**How do I use Microsoft Bookings?**

Bookings is an online service, no need to download anything. Just go to the app chooser within the Microsoft 365 web experience. The admin can also use the Bookings companion app to stay up to date on the latest information for customers and appointments.

**Who has access to Microsoft Bookings?**

Bookings is available as on by default for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, A3, A5, E3, and E5 customers worldwide. For special cloud instances, Bookings is currently available in Gallatin.

**Will my customers see my personal or business calendar?**

Your customers will only see the Bookings calendar that you publish online for the services, times, and staff you register.

**How do end users access the app? **

Anyone who is licensed for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, A3, A5, E3, E5, or is added as Staff in either an “Administrator” or “Viewer” roles can access Bookings in the app chooser within the Microsoft 365 web experience. There is also a companion app available for iOS and Android.

**Can I use Bookings in my own website?**

Yes. We provide a way for you to embed your Bookings calendar in your site via an iFrame. Link embedding code is located in the “Bookings page” tab within the Bookings app.

**Can I use Bookings even if I don’t have a web page for my business?**

Yes. We provide a link to your booking page within the “Booking page” tab in the web app. You just need to provide that link to your customers or clients, and they will see the latest availability information for your business. Alternatively, you can share the booking page in social media or even use the embed feature to host it in an iFrame. You also have the ability to control who can access the page by disabling direct search engine indexing and restricting access to only those within your organization.

**  
Can our IT department control whether end users have access to Bookings? **

Bookings is available in Business Premium, M365 A3/A5 and E3/E5 tenants by default, but administrators can turn it off in the Microsoft 365 admin center if they choose. To do so, [follow these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-microsoft-bookings-on-or-off-for-your-organization-c27537fa-525e-47a8-aadf-9b07ee75c227).

If a customer wants to disable access to this product for certain eligible licenses in their tenant, they can either user a group policy to restrict licenses or implement an OWA Mailbox Policy that will restrict who is able to create new Bookings calendars.

With the OWA Mailbox Policy, all users will have a Bookings license, when they attempt to access the app, they will only be successful if they are part of the policy or have been added to an existing Bookings calendar as staff. Details [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-access-to-microsoft-bookings-5382dc07-aaa5-45c9-8767-502333b214ce?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) in the “Allow only selected users to create Bookings calendars” section.

**Is it customizable?**

Bookings is extremely customizable and can be used for a variety of different scenarios. When setting up a Bookings calendar, many aspects of the web-based scheduling page, business information, staff detail, service types, and scheduling policies can be customized.

**  
Is all the functionality of the original Bookings web app available in Teams?**

A lightweight version of Bookings is now available via an app in Teams. Please find the initial announcement [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/06/empowering-care-teams-with-new-tools-in-microsoft-365/). There is deep link functionality to pop out in the web app, and after setup, day-to-day use of Bookings can be done without ever leaving Teams. Information flows across platforms.

**Is Bookings a small business offering or an Enterprise offering or both?**

Bookings is an ideal solution for both Enterprise and SMB customers across a variety of industries. Use cases include:

<span id="Pricing" class="anchor"></span>**Pricing/Licensing**

**How do I get Microsoft Bookings?**

Bookings is available for customers with Business Premium, A3, A5, E3, and E5 licenses. Bookings is not available standalone and is only available as a web app, with an iOS and Android companion app. OWA must be enabled to use Bookings, as it sits within Outlook on the web. Details on obtaining a license can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-access-to-microsoft-bookings-5382dc07-aaa5-45c9-8767-502333b214ce?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

A Bookings license provides full functionality to the product, including creating and managing calendars. It also enables the ability to view/edit existing calendars when added as staff in a “administrator” or “viewer” role.

**Do I need to migrate my email account from my current provider to Microsoft 365?**

You can keep your current provider, but Bookings will send all notifications to the email used in your Microsoft 365 account.

**Can my employees use Bookings without a Microsoft 365 account?**

Yes. You can add your staff with any email, and they will still get the email confirmation and the calendar invite when someone books an appointment with them.

**Can I create more than one Bookings calendar under the same Microsoft 365 account and switch between them?**

Yes. You can create and manage more than one Bookings calendar with one account. You can switch between them using the caret next to the business name in the Bookings web app.

**What if my organization has mixed licenses with F1/F3, E1, and E3/E5?**

To manage the full set of Bookings features, enterprise customers a Microsoft 365 Business Premium, A3, A5, E3, or E5 license. We recognize many organizations have a mixture of Microsoft 365 licensing. For example, a customer may have M365 E3 licenses for HQ employees and M365 E1 (or F1 or F3) licenses for their store employees.

The HQ employees with an M365 E3 license will have full access to Bookings, which means they can create new calendars, edit settings, add staff, publish a booking page, create/manage appointments within the calendar, and pull reporting.

The store employees with E1/F1/F3 licenses, or with no licenses, can still be added as staff to calendars in a "guest" role to be booked and will receive confirmation emails when booked. They can still be booked during their available/scheduled hours as listed in the staff tab. The Bookings calendar availability constrains bookable times by their set hours and service hours.

They will also still be triggered as unavailable in Bookings if an appointment has already been scheduled through the Bookings web app or page. Appointments booked via Bookings will reflect as busy on a staff’s calendar within Bookings. Staff with a non-Bookings enabled license can still have their personal/work calendar impact Bookings availability if they are within the same tenant.

“Guests” can view any of the information the customer has provided within the initial appointment creation. For example, if the Store Representative who is booked for the appointment is required to call the customer prior to the appointment, they will have access to the information the customer provides during the scheduling process. The staff member that is booked will have access to all information that appears in the confirmation email, as well as the .ics calendar event (such as the customer phone number if it was inputted when bookings).

These “guest” users will not have the ability to access the Bookings web app to change settings or view and manage appointments (add/cancel/reschedule); however, they can make appointments on behalf of customers using the self-service page, as a customer would.

We would recommend licensing a business manager/admin of each store with a Bookings-eligible license to set up and manage pages and appointments. The rest of the staff would then work with the employee licensed with Bookings to reschedule or cancel a booking.

<span id="Product" class="anchor"></span>**Product Features**

**Where do Bookings calendars show up in my tenant? **

Each Bookings calendar that is created creates a corresponding mailbox within Exchange, as well as a related entry in AAD, listed as an unlicensed user.

**Can I delete a previously created Bookings calendar? **

In order to delete a Bookings calendar you must delete the associated mailbox within Exchange.

**If I create a calendar and someone else has access to Bookings, would they be able to see my calendar? **

The only people who have access to the Bookings calendar you have created (through the web app) is anyone added as Staff in either an “Administrator” or “Viewer” role. Tenant admins will be able to see a list of all Bookings mailboxes in Exchange/AAD.

**Are video conferencing meetings integrated into the Bookings app? **

Online meetings are available within Bookings when using Skype or Teams meeting clients. Online meetings can be enabled at a service-level and the meeting client used is the one that is set as default for the booked staff member. For online meetings, each new appointment that is scheduled will have a unique meeting link generated and attached to the appointment, with easy join options in the event and confirmation emails.

![](c:\\GitHub\\microsoft-365-docs-pr\\microsoft-365\\bookings/media/image2.png)**How does scheduling policy work?**

Max lead time is the farthest in advance that a booking can be made. There must be 24hrs between Min and Max lead time. Max lead time can be set to 1 day if Min lead time is set to 0hrs, thus meaning that a customer can cancel a booking up until the time that it starts, and customers can only schedule bookings if the appointment is within the next 1 day.

**How does Bookings work across time zones?**

![](c:\\GitHub\\microsoft-365-docs-pr\\microsoft-365\\bookings/media/image3.png)All times are in the "business" time zone by default - meaning any setting you configure for a Booking calendar, such as working hours, will be with respect to the "business" time zone. The self-service booking page has the ability to display all the booking times in the end-user's time zone.

This can be turned off if desired. If "Always show time slots in business time zone" remains unchecked on the Bookings Page tab, then people visiting the page will see time slots in their native time zones.

There is no provision to set time zone at staff-level in Bookings. Staff time zone, and thus business hours, will be in the “business” time zone.

**Can email notifications be sent as the tenant domain name?**

The email addresses are controlled and managed at the M365 settings level and depends on the Domain configuration there. More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mail-flow/get-accepteddomain?view=exchange-ps).

**Is the ability to send SMS messages dependent on a different service or specific configuration?**

SMS messages are currently available in North America and a Skype or Twilio account will be used for SMS delivery.

**How can Bookings appointments show up on a person’s calendar? **

The booking confirmation is sent to both the service provider’s and customer’s inbox. The confirmation email contains a .ics file attachment that can be added to the user’s calendar with all relevant appointment details.

**What triggers service provider/staff and customer emails?**

Emails are triggered based on setting in the Services tab in the Bookings web app. A booking made by the customer on the self-service page or via the Calendar tab on the Bookings web app, or a change to that booking made by either party (via the “Manage booking” button in the confirmation email or within the web app), will trigger confirmation and/or reminder emails. Reminder emails are sent at a specified time period prior to an appointment, as detailed in the Services tab in the Bookings web app.

**Can I book class-style appointments that are 1:many instead of 1:1? **

Yes, we have a group bookings functionality that allows multiple people to book the same appointment at the same time. This functionality is at a service-level. It is described in detail [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bookings-blog/microsoft-bookings-now-supports-online-meetings-and-group/ba-p/1214120).

**Can calendars not be published (i.e. public facing) but still accessible to designated users?**

Yes. There is a check box on the “Booking page” tab in the web app (below) that can restrict self-service page access to only those that are within the tenant. The Bookings calendar that sits within the web app for creation and management can only be access by those added as Staff to the page with “Administrator” or “Viewer” roles.

**How frequently does state of the Home page update?**

It is fetched whenever the web app is loaded in real-time. For further details, visit this [support link](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/bookings-what-do-these-numbers-mean-060a9781-c8a2-4e85-a769-31e6417d05b3?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

**Can I turn off the email notifications for Time Off?**

Recording Time Off within the Bookings web app will always trigger a notification email to staff members. If they are confusing to the staff member, we suggest you add more detail in the notes or title of the Time Off to better inform staff about what is occurring on the admin side.

**Can Bookings calendars be cloned/duplicated and templatized for easy scaling?**

The ability to duplicate pages is currently available via PowerShell. The process would be to leverage the Graph API to get Mailbox details and then use them to create a new mailbox. API documentation is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/booking-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta).

.

**What reporting is available in Bookings?**

All Bookings calendar staff that are in the “administrator” role download a Tab Separated Values (TSV) file with all Bookings done in the past 120 days. Bookings reports can be downloaded in TSV form from the Home tab of the Bookings page. The Bookings API can also be used to collect this data for more customized and specific purposes.

**Is it possible to share only one service on the self-service page at once? **

Yes, you can either create separate Bookings calendar for each service, or you can go to the Services tab, edit a service, and at the top you will see an option to share a URL only for that specific service.

**What options are available for embedding a consent form or disclosure for those booking an appointment? **

We recommend enabling the “Customer data usage consent” in the Booking page tba and customizing the wording to properly convey disclosure or consent requirements. Other option is to add a “Custom Field” to the service that includes a link to the consent form and have them select that they have completed the form before they make an appointment. You can also add the consent form URL as Additional Notes in the confirmation/reminder email, but this will not prevent them from booking an appointment.

**What changes can be made to the staff selection capability on the self-service booking page?**

The staff selection by customer can be removed altogether by unchecking “All customers to choose a specific person for the booking” option from Booking page or Services section. Bookings will automatically assign an available staff member at random to the booking, based on their availability.

**Can the “Manage Booking” option be removed from the customer confirmation email? **

When a customer books their own appointment (or an appointment is booked on behalf of them) on the self-service page, they will always have the “Manage Booking” option regardless of the setting. The “Let the customer manage their booking” check in the Services option only impacts if customers will see “Manage Booking” when a booking is made for them via a staff member on the Calendar tab of the Bookings web app.

**Can Bookings support many concurrent booking requests and self-service page visits?  **

Booking can support a large quantity of visitors and booking at one time. If the page experiences a very large volume of traffic users will receive a “server busy” error. Appointment availability is updated when the page is loaded, as well as when a booking is made. If multiple people are trying to book the same appointment at one time, Bookings will only let one person book that time and give a “Someone beat you to it” message to the others and prompt them to find another time.

**Data/Compliance/Privacy**

**Where is Bookings data stored?**

Bookings is a Microsoft 365 app, meaning all data is stored within Substrate/Exchange and follows all data storage policies set by Microsoft and all Office apps. Bookings uses shared mailboxes in Exchange to store all the customer, staff, service, and appointment details. Compliance policies for shared mailboxes in Exchange also apply for Bookings mailboxes. All customer data (including information provided by customers when booking) is captured in Bookings and is stored within the app, thus within Exchange. Microsoft Bookings uses the same policies used by Microsoft 365, which you can find [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/online/legal/v2/?docid=22&langid=en-us)

**Is there a way to centrally manage Bookings calendars for all users? **

Each Bookings calendar is maintained independently. There is no consolidated view, other than the search drop down after clicking the caret on the home page.

**How are users authenticated?**

Access to the Bookings web app involves authentication via the regular AAD authentication. The self-service booking page can be made available to everyone with the webpage link; however, when the “Require a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account from my organization to book” setting is selected, the page is restricted for use only within the tenant (using AAD authentication).

Description automatically generated](c:\\GitHub\\microsoft-365-docs-pr\\microsoft-365\\bookings/media/image5.png)

**Does customer data leave the production system for any reason?  **

Yes, since Bookings is a part of Exchange, we allow Graph API/EWS APIs for the customers to download their own data to which they have access to.

**  
Is there the ability to customize email addresses for customer replies? **

There is the ability to define what email customer replies are sent to – this setting is in the “Business Information” tab. The Bookings mailbox name itself can be changed within Exchange through usual Exchange mailbox renaming processes.

**We would like for the customer to accept our terms and conditions during the booking process. Is that possible?**  
This feature already exists for GDPR compliance. The “Booking page” tab has a field for custom consent, right under the publishing details section. Just check that box and write your own custom consent message and it will show up as a required field on the self-service page that will be recorded with the date and time that the end user accepts it on.

This section does not support rich text but think links can be added under the “Business Information” section and would show up just below the consent check box.

**How can Bookings-associated mailboxes in Exchange be identified?**

The following command can be used to retrieve information of all Bookings mailboxes and users who have access to them.

Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails SchedulingMailbox -ResultSize:Unlimited | Get-MailboxPermission |Select-Object Identity,User,AccessRights | Where-Object {($\_.user -like '\*@\*')}

               

<span id="Technical" class="anchor"></span>**Technical Questions**

**If a user schedules an appointment for a service with an online meeting, how do they receive the Teams link if they leave the optional email address field empty?**

If the system does not have the customer email information there is no way for the confirmation mail to be delivered to the customer, and thus they will not receive a Teams link. The solution is to keep the email address as a required field from the Services tab of Bookings. When you create a new service in Bookings, the customer email field is by default set as a required field unless changed by the admin.

**How are staff assigned to appointments when “Anyone” is selected, or when customers do not have the ability to choose a staff member for the appointment?**

Staff are assigned in these scenarios via a randomization function from available staff. Currently there is no way to weight this or cap the number of assigned appointments to each person. If there is load-balancing that needs to be done after random assignment, it can be done manually in the Calendar tab within the Bookings page.

**How can users opt out of receiving SMS messages if they have already opted in previously?**

When booking an appointment with SMS messages enabled, customers will be prompted to check the opt in box each time. Customers can also reply directly to the SMS message (the SMS provider) indicating they would like the message to cease, and then no further texts will be sent to that phone number. If the customer opts out of receiving SMS from the provider, not from Bookings itself, they will no longer receive SMS messages in the future, even when opting in from the Bookings page.
