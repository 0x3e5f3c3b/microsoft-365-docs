# View your Booking calendar

The Calendar tab in Bookings contains a view of all staff and their respective free/busy information, as well as appointments that have been scheduled via Bookings. New appointments can be booked directly from this page.

1. In Microsoft 365, select the app launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Calendar**.

Create a new booking two different ways:

1. Select the **New booking** button at the top-left of the page.

    a) Select the service you would like to book from the drop-down menu. These are the services that have been created in the Services tab.

    b) Fill out the customer information, choose a time for the service, and then select an available staff member.

2. Click or select directly within the calendar.

    a) The time of the appointment and assigned staff member will auto-populate, based on where the calendar was initially clicked or selected, but these options can be changed.

    b) Fill out customer information and select the service from the drop-down menu.

    Note that all fields and settings will populate based on configurations made in the Services page, but edits to these field can still be made in the booking window when creating a booking within the Calendar tab.

Additional configuration options on the Calendar tab include:

- **View/edit an existing booking** Select the event from the calendar and click **Edit** or **Open Booking** in the top-right corner of the event window.

- **View calendar by day, work week, week, or month** Appointments are differentiated by staff member by color (colors are assigned to staff members in the Staff tab). Staff calendars can be viewed side-by-side in the “Day” view.

- Time off can be added directly to the calendar, in order to block staff calendars and ensure those individuals are not bookable on specific days. This can be used for time off, vacation, or sick days.

- Agenda and calendar-view of the schedule can be printed using the **Print** button in the top ribbon.
