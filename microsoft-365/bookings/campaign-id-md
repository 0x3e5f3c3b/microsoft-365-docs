# Add a campaign ID to Bookings URL

Keep track of your Bookings marketing campaigns by adding a campaign ID to the end of your Booking page URL.

Use a campaign ID to see how your marketing campaigns are doing. All you have to do is add a campaign ID you select to the end of your Bookings page URL and use them in your different marketing platforms to see which of your campaigns are connecting with customers.

## Add campaign ID

1. In Microsoft 365, select the App launcher, and then select **Bookings**.

2. Choose your calendar and in the left navigation pane, select **Booking page** and copy your booking page URL and paste it into a text editing program, like Notepad.

3. Add a campaign ID to the end of the URL. For example, if your booking page URL looks like this, https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/, you would choose an ID to add to the end. For example, if you wanted to track your booking details from Twitter, you could add Twitter to the end of the URL. New URL would be, https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/TailspinToys@contosopetscom.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/?RefID=Twitter. Use different campaign IDs to track where your bookings are coming from.


## Track campaign IDs






Tracking is used by companies to see how their marketing campaigns are working. Using this parameter, the bookings admin can keep track of the source of origin of the customer. This helps bookings admins/marketers optimize their marketing campaigns but sort of keeps some tracking information of the end customer.
