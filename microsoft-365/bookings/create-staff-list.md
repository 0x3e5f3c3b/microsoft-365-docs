# Create your staff list

The Staff page in the Microsoft Bookings app is where you create your staffing list and manage staff member details such as name, phone number, and email address. You can also set working hours for each staff member from this part of the app.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookings is turned on by default for customers who have the Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 A3, or Microsoft 365 A5 subscriptions. Bookings is also available to customers who have Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Office 365 Enterprise E5, but it is turned off by default. To turn it on, see [Get access to Microsoft Bookings](get-access.md).

## Add staff

Although Bookings is a feature of Microsoft 365, not all of your staff members are required to have a Microsoft 365 account. All staff members must have a valid email address so they can receive bookings and schedule changes.

Watch this video or follow the steps below to add your staff.
