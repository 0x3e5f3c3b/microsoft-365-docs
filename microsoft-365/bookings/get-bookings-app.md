# Get the Microsoft Bookings app for iOS and Android

Microsoft Bookings is available as a mobile app for iOS and Android.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings mobile apps are not yet available worldwide. This article lists those locales where the apps are available now.

## Bookings app for iOS

The Bookings app for iOS is available in all regions and countries that Apple supports. You can download the app from the [iTunes App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-bookings/id1065657468).

## Bookings app for Android (US and Canada)

The Bookings app for Android is available for download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.exchange.bookings) in the US and Canada.

## View-only mode

Any user who is not granted read-write access in Bookings can still use the mobile app in view-only mode. Anyone with a Bookings license who gets added to a booking calendar can see their own and their colleaguesâ€™ schedules, appointment details, and business information. A user with view-only access can't make changes or edits and cannot access the customer list.
