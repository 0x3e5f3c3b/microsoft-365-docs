# Get the Microsoft Bookings app for iOS and Android

The Bookings mobile apps are not yet available worldwide. This article lists those locales where the apps are available now.

## Bookings app for iOS

The Bookings app for iOS is available in all regions and countries that Apple supports. You can download the app from the [iTunes App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-bookings/id1065657468).

If you use an iPad as your point-of-sale system or use it in landscape view, Bookings pages now rotates to give you more flexibility as you use the Bookings app.

## Bookings app for Android (US and Canada)

The Bookings app for Android is available for download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.exchange.bookings) in the US and Canada.

## View-only mode in the Bookings mobile app

You can now use view-only mode in the Bookings app. Anyone with a Bookings license who gets added to a booking calendar can download and use the Bookings mobile app to see their own and their colleagues’ schedules, the bookings’ details, and business information. An employee or user with view-only access can't change or edit anything and doesn't have access to the customer list.
