# Manage group attendees in Bookings

Owners and staff members of a Bookings calendar can now manage and update attendees for group services. For more information on service offerings in Bookings, see [Define your service offerings in Bookings](define-service-offerings.md).

Sometimes you might have to manage Booking attendees for multi service Bookings on behalf of customers, let us consider a scenario where we need to remove some attendees from group service booked using Microsoft Bookings:

Example

Consider one booking with a maximum of 10 participants

5 people have registered/booked for the service

I want to remove 2 of the registered people

Users who have owner/edit permission to Bookingâ€™s calendar can follow the steps below to remove the attendees and update the bookings.

Created Group Booking with maximum attendees set to more than 1 as below:

The owner will have the calendar showing the Group Booking as below:

Managing Group Bookings just got easy as click on Add Customer let you add attendee

Click on attendee you want to edit details or remove

Removing the attendee will trigger the cancellation email for both attendee :

## Troubleshooting

If you run into the following issues while using group bookings, follow the steps below.

- Editing of a group booking service from the Teams app or from the mobile app resets attendees **to**, use the Bookings web app to edit the group booking service.

- Bookings doesn't support resource bookings at this time. To workaround this, create a resource as a staff member and assign it to a servce.
