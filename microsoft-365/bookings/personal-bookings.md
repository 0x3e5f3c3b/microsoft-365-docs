# Personal Bookings

Personal bookings takes the back and forth out of scheduling while helping you maintain control over your calendar. Personal bookings is a web-based personal scheduling page that integrates with your free/busy information from your Outlook calendar. You may create custom meeting types to share with others so they can easily find a time to schedule 1:1 meetings with you according to your availability and preferences. When someone schedules a meeting with you using your personal bookings page, you will both receive email confirmation. Attendees can also update or cancel scheduled meetings with you directly from your personal bookings page.
