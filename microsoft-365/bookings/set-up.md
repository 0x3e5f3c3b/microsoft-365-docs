# Set up Microsoft Bookings

Thanks for downloading the Microsoft Bookings app! Before getting started, you need to set up Bookings on the web. You can do this from your Outlook on the web email account or from any other Microsoft 365 app.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookings is turned on by default for customers who have the Microsoft 365 Business Standard, or Microsoft 365 A3 and Microsoft 365 A5 subscriptions. Bookings is also available to customers who have Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Office 365 Enterprise E5, but it is turned off by default. To turn it on, see **Get access to the Microsoft 365 business apps for enterprise subscriptions - INSERT LINK**.


1. Can't find the app you're looking for? From the app launcher, select All apps to see an alphabetical list of the Microsoft 365 apps available to you. From there, you can search for a specific app
