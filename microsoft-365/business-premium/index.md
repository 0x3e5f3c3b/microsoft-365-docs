# Microsoft 365 Business Premium Overview

Let us begin by saying that you made a wise choice in adopting Microsoft 365 Business Premium. There are other small business productivity tools out there, but none of them compare to Microsoft 365 Business Premium for keeping your organization safe from cybercriminals.

You took on the defense of your organization's systems, and that's good. You are your organization’s first and best defense against hackers and cybercriminals, including random individuals, organized crime, or even highly sophisticated nation-states. This is the task before you. Let Microsoft 365 Business Premium help you secure your organization’s future.  

Success depends on you completing the assigned missions ahead which are grouped by category of importance. These will allow you to thwart hackers, protect against ransomware, and ensure that your organization’s purpose and potential are not disrupted. Let's get started.

## [Fortify](#tab/Fortify)

In these first missions, you're going to have to sign in and set up your initial protective walls of defense, starting with account access protections.

[**Set up your environment**](m365bp-setup-overview.md). In this first mission, you set up and implement security across all accounts in the system.

[**Bump up security protection**](m365bp-security-overview.md). Set up a number of critical security safeguards to protect your organization. 

## [Train](#tab/Train)

We've included a set of missions here with some objectives that need to be completed by your team. You have to make sure the team's devices are protected, as well as that the team is trained to use email and file sharing safely, and to recognize and report threats. 

[**Set up BYOD devices**](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md). In this mission, you set up all the unmanaged (BYOD) devices so they are safely part of the ecosystem.

[**Protect email**](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md). In this mission, take the necessary steps to protect the email systems from attack.

[**Collaborate and share securely**](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md). The objectives of this mission require you to set up secure file sharing for all members of the organization.

## Safeguard managed devices

A safe device is one that is monitored by the organization. In this last critical mission, you will onboard and enroll devices in Microsoft Defender for Business so they are secured and protected with the best tools available.

[**Set up and secure managed devices**](m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>There are times when a side quest takes you away from the mission at-hand. When this happens, do not abandon your mission but instead, return and carry on. It's for the good of the org!

NOTE: I THINK THIS IMAGE SHOULD BE RE-DONE TO REFLECT 6 MISSIONS, AND STYLISTICALLY TO HAVE A "DEFENDER" CHARACTER (SUCH AS IN THE POSTER) IN THE BACKGROUND BEHIND THE FRONT LAYER VISUALS FOR EACH MISSION CATEGORY. THE OBJECTIVES FOR EACH MISSION CAN BE BULLET POINTS IN EACH SECTION IN THE GRAPHIC.
