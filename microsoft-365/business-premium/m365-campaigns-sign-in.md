# Sign in to Microsoft 365 Business Premium

## For business or campaign admins

If you signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium), you're the Microsoft 365 admin (also referred to as the Global Administrator). Here's how to sign in:

1. Find the username and password that we sent to the email address that you used when you [signed up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](m365-campaigns-sign-up.md).

2. In the browser, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.

3. Type your username and password. Select **Sign in**.

4. In the top right of the page, find the **Preview on** control. Select **Preview on** so you can use all the controls described in [Bump up protection for your campaign](m365-campaigns-security-overview.md).

## For staff

Users who have been added to your Microsoft 365 for Campaigns (or Microsoft 365 Business Premium) subscription can sign in by following these steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://office.com" target="_blank">https://Office.com</a>.

2. Sign in using the user name and password for the account. Users will have this information in the email they received when they were added as users.

> [!TIP]
> Give your staff a link to the [Employee quick setup guide](../admin/setup/employee-quick-setup.md). The guidance walks them through signing in, getting Office apps, and saving, copying, and sharing files.
