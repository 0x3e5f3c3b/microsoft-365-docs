# Collaborate and share securely

## Overview

You're already armed with the protection afforded by the Office apps, but your next mission is to set up protections for file sharing and communication. Focus on setting up protections so that members of your organization can safely share files. This is the data and information that your organization is built upon, so protect the files with everything you've got!

Your objectives are as follows:

- [Create Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md)
- [Set up meetings](set-up-meetings.md)
- [Share files and videos](share-files-and-videos.md)
- [Create a communication site](create-communication-site.md)

After you complete these objectives, start your [final mission](m365bp-protect-devices.md).
