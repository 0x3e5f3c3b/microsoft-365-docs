# Set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium devices

## Overview

You probably know this, but every  device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be monitored and managed properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. In this critical mission, you will set up protection for all the bring-your-own devices (BYODs), which are those that are most risky to your organization due to them being unmanaged. It's a good idea to get these devices protected as soon as possible. 

Your objectives are as follows:

- [Set up MFA](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md)
- [Install Office apps](m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md)
- [Protected unmanaged PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md)

Once you've accomplished these objectives, proceed with your [next mission](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md).

## Set up devices

Take a few minutes to set up devices to work with your environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.

To set up devices:

1. Each user [sets up their mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json).
2. For unmanaged devices, users set up their [PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).
For key staff, we recommend that you use [managed devices](../business/set-up-windows-devices.md) for even better protection. For all devices, you'll want to set up [multifactor authentication](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
3. All users should learn how to protect themselves and your campaign by learning about [phishing and other attacks](avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)(avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md) and to use [encryption](send-encrypted-email.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your campaign from online threats.

## Admins: Set up Microsoft 365

The following diagram describes how admins set up Microsoft 365.

![Steps to set up Microsoft 365.](../media/M365-democracy-SetUpProcess.png)

After you've [signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../admin/admin-overview/sign-up-for-office-365.md)), complete setup by [running the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

For all organizations, bump up security protection by: [protecting admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md), [protecting access to mail and data](m365bp-conditional-access.md), and [increasing threat protection](m365bp-increase-protection.md).

## Everyone: Set up your devices

Users will need to take a few minutes to set up devices to work with this environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them to get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.
