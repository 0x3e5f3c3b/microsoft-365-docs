# Maintain your environment

The [missions](index.md) that were completed during the setup and configuration process focused on setting up your subscription, user accounts, and devices, as well as securing users, devices, and data. Now, you can put together plans for security operations and administration. 

## Security operations 

Security operations (also referred to as *SecOps*) includes tasks that your security team performs in the Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)).

As threats are detected, those threats must be reviewed and addressed. Regular antivirus scans should occur on devices, and you can initiate scans when needed. In addition, you can run automated investigations on devices that have a high risk level or detected threats. These kinds of security tasks (and more!) are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-operations-guide.md).

## Administration

Administration includes tasks that your administrators (also referred to as *admins*) perform in the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)).

As new employees come in and other employees leave, it's important to manage user accounts and devices. Your admins can add or remove users, reset passwords, reset devices to factory settings, and more. These kinds of tasks (and more!) are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium administrator guide](m365bp-admin-ops-guide.md).
