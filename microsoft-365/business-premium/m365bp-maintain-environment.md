# Maintain your environment

The missions you completed during the previous six missions focus on setting up your systems, user accounts, and securing your users, devices, and data. Now, you can put together plans for security operations and administration. 

## Security operations 



As you know, security management is important. As threats are detected, those threats must be reviewed and addressed. Regular antivirus scans should occur on devices, and you can initiate scans when needed. In addition, you can run automated investigations on devices that have a high risk level or detected threats. These kinds of security tasks are listed in the [Microsoft 365 Business Premium security operations guide](m365bp-security-operations-guide.md).

Your business also needs a maintenance and operations plan. As new employees come in and other employees leave, it's important to manage user accounts and devices. 

The missions you completed during the setup and configuration process were all about getting your systems, users, and data secured. Now, you'll need to perform certain tasks, such as adding or removing users, resetting passwords, and resetting devices to factory settings as needed. These kinds of tasks are what maintaining your environment is all about.
