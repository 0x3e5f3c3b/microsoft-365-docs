# Plan for managed and unmanaged devices

An important part of your security strategy is protecting the devices your employees use to access company data. Such devices include computers, tablets, and phones. Whether these devices are managed or unmanaged, there are steps that can be taken to protect devices and data, as summarized in the following table:

| Types of devices | Ways to protect devices |
|:---|:---|
| **Managed devices**<br/>Managed devices are usually set up, configured, and monitored by your company's IT or security team. | To protect managed devices, your organization's IT or security team can: <br/>- Use Autopilot to get a user's Windows device ready for use. With Autopilot you can install business critical apps, apply policies, and enable features like BitLocker. <br/>- Upgrade Windows devices to Windows 10 or 11 Pro (certain requirements apply).  <br/>- Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business to and protect them with mobile threat defense capabilities. Or, enroll devices in Microsoft Intune and use Mobile Device Management capabilities.<br/>- Monitor onboarded devices for threat detections and take appropriate response actions. <br/>- Require or start antivirus scans and updates. |
| **Unmanaged devices** <br/>Unmanaged devices, often referred to as bring-your-own devices, or *BYOD*, tend to be personally owned devices that employees set up and use. | With Microsoft 365 Business Premium, users can:<br/>- Make sure antivirus/antimalware software is installed and up to date on all devices. (Microsoft Defender Antivirus is included in Windows 10, Windows 11, and in versions of Windows Server.)<br/>- Keep devices up to date, with current updates for operating systems, applications, and antivirus sofware. <br/>- Turn on device encryption to help prevent unauthorized users from accessing data.  |
