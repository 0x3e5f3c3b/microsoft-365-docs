# Set up multi-factor authentication on your mobile device

Multi-factor authentication provides more security for your business, because instead of simply a password, or a code through text, an app is used to verify access, which makes it extremely difficult to hack. When the Admin requires MFA, you can use the Microsoft Authenticator app to let you securely log into the key apps with your phone.

## Use the Outlook app in your devices

After your admin has required you to use MFA and you've set up an authenticator app as a second form of authentication, we recommend that you install and only use the Outlook app to access your Microsoft 365 email. See [Set up mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md) for how to install Office apps, including Outlook, on your phone.
