# Set up and secure managed devices

Welcome to your final critical mission. Here, you will onboard and implement protection for all the managed devices in your organization. Onboard with Defender to ensure malware and antivirus is always up-to-date, and set policies that help lock down your systems. Rest assured, you've done what you can to be protected once these objectives have been achieved!

Your mission objectives:

- [Set up managed devices](m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md)
- [Onboard enrolled devices and apply policies](m365bp-onboard-devices-mdb.md)
- [Review and edit device policies](m365bp-view-edit-create-mdb-policies.md)
- [Manage device groups](m365bp-device-groups-mdb.md)

Once these objectives have been achieved, your overall mission to protect the org is a success! Now, make sure to set up your response teams to deal with any situation that may arise while defending the integrity of the system.
