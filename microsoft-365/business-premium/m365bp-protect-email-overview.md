# Protect all email

## Overview

As you know, emails are full of malicious attacks parading as harmless emails. Email systems are especially vulnerable because email is handled by everyone in the company to communicate, and it relies upon humans making consistently safe decisions with those communications. 

In this mission, you are ensuring email systems are safe from these attackers. 

The mission objectives are to:

- [Protect against phishing and other attacks](m365-campaigns-phishing-an-attacks.md)
- [Set up encrypted email](send-encrypted-email.md)

Accomplish these objectives before you move on to the [next mission](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md).
   
<!---
To protect email:

All users should learn how to protect the organizations email systems by learning about [phishing and other attacks](m365-campaigns-phishing-and-attacks.md) and to use [encryption](send-encrypted-email.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your business from online threats.

## Admins: Set up Microsoft 365

The following diagram describes how admins set up Microsoft 365.

![Steps to set up Microsoft 365.](../media/M365-democracy-SetUpProcess.png)

After you've [signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../admin/admin-overview/sign-up-for-office-365.md)), complete setup by [running the setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure the core settings.

For all organizations, bump up security protection by: [protecting admin accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md), [protecting access to mail and data](m365bp-conditional-access.md), and [increasing threat protection](m365bp-increase-protection.md).

## Everyone: Set up your devices

Users will need to take a few minutes to set up devices to work with this environment. For your key users (those who are the highest value targets for hackers), you can set up and pre-configure new devices. This helps them to get started when they sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials.

To set up user devices:

1. Each user [sets up their mobile devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json).
2. For unmanaged devices, users set up their [PCs and Macs](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).
For key staff, we recommend that you use [managed devices](../business/set-up-windows-devices.md) for even better protection. For all devices, you'll want to set up [multifactor authentication](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
3. All users should learn how to protect themselves and your campaign by learning about [phishing and other attacks](m365-campaigns-phishing-and-attacks.md). This [infographic](m365-campaigns-protect-campaign-infographic.md) can also help your users understand how to help protect your campaign from online threats.
