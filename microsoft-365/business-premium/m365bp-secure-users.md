## Train your users

The security recommendations provided in this library make it much harder for cyber attackers to gain access to your environment. However, an important part of your security strategy includes training users&mdash; the people in your company who use your systems regularly. Users can help be your front line of defense. They need to be aware of how to work productively while maintaining a more secure environment. 

We have resources to help you train your users in all of these areas:

- [Using email securely](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md)

- [Protecting their devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md) (company managed, or personal devices that people use to access company data)

- [Collaborating and sharing information securely](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md)

Use the recommendations in this library to help your users be productive and more secure in their work.

## Use email more securely

All users should be aware of and use these email practices to help keep their email secure:

- Set up email to use multi-factor authentication with the authenticator app

- Verify legitimate emails and look for safety tips from advanced anti-phishing protection

- Allow Safe Links and Safe Attachments protection to check URLs and email attachments

Learn more about [multi-factor authentication](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md) and [phishing and other attacks](avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md).

[PDF](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/f/91fa8f24-9953-4f33-9d87-a95624db5e0b/M365BPWhatCanUsersDoToSecure.pdf) | [PowerPoint](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/f/91fa8f24-9953-4f33-9d87-a95624db5e0b/M365BPWhatCanUsersDoToSecure.pptx)

## Set up iOS and Android devices

Remind users to take a few minutes to [set up their iPhones and Android devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md) to work more securely:

- Set up devices to use multi-factor authentication with the authenticator app

- Use Microsoft mobile apps, such as Microsoft Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and other Microsoft apps from the app store. The native mail apps that are included on iPhones and Android devices aren't supported

- Require a PIN for users to unlock their device.

After setting these up, your users will be prompted to use the authenticator app when accessing your organization data on these devices, including email.

## Protect BYOD Mac and Windows devices

It's also important that users keep their primary work device up to date:

- Install the latest versions of Office desktop apps and keep these fresh with updates, when prompted.
- Stay on top of operating system updates, such as Windows updates.

For [unmanaged Windows and Mac devices](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md), users have the responsibility to ensure that basic security features are enabled.

### Enable basic security capabilities on BYOD Windows and Mac devices

| Windows 10 and 11 | macOS |
|:-----|:------|
|Turn on BitLocker device protection<p><p> Ensure Windows Defender remains on <p>Turn on Windows Firewall| Use FileVault to encrypt the Mac disk <p><p>Use a reliable antivirus software <p>Turn on firewall protection|

To learn more about these recommendations, see [Protect your account and devices from hackers and malware](https://support.office.com/article/Protect-your-account-and-devices-from-hackers-and-malware-066d6216-a56b-4f90-9af3-b3a1e9a327d6#ID0EAABAAA=Windows_10).

## Collaborate more securely with Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint

Your users might be tempted to share and store your organization files in places other than Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 makes it as easy as possible to collaborate and share securely. You can [share files and videos](share-files-and-videos.md) directly from Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, Stream, and even from within a file. Sharing from within these tools helps keep your data from leaking. You can add additional protection to sensitive data to prevent sharing outside your organization.

## Manage and protect company devices

We recommend that your most important staff members use freshly acquired Windows devices that you manage. We'll show you how to [Set up managed devices](m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md) and apply security policies to protect them.
