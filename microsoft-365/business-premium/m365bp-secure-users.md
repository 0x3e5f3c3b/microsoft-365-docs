# How Microsoft 365 Business Premium helps your business

## Features

(FEATURES OF BP HERE)

## Train your users

The security recommendations provided here make it much harder for cyber attackers to gain access to your environment. As the one responsible for the integrity of the network, your front line is the members of the org who use the systems regularly. The tradeoff is your users need to be aware of how to work within and maintain a more secure environment. Training these front-line users in proper safeguarding and maintenance of the network plays a big part in overall security. We understand a little extra patience is required, but it's worth it to keep the organization protected. 

This information summarizes a number of security recommendations specific to end-users. The same tasks are covered in the course of the following missions, but it's helpful to be aware of it up-front.

## Use secure email practices

All users should be aware of and use these email practices to help keep their email secure:

- Set up email to use multi-factor authentication with the authenticator app.
- Verify legitimate emails and look for safety tips from advanced anti-phishing protection
- Allow Safe Links and Safe Attachments protection to check URLs and email attachments

## Set up iPhones and Android devices

All users you add to your environment will need to take a few minutes to [setup iPhones and Android devices](../business/set-up-mobile-devices.md?toc=%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fcampaigns%2Ftoc.json) to work securely:

- Set up devices to use multi-factor authentication with the authenticator app.
- Use Microsoft mobile apps, including Outlook Mobile, Word, OneDrive, and other Microsoft apps from the app store. The native mail apps that are included on iPhones and Android devices aren't supported.
- Require a PIN for users to unlock their device.

After setting these up, your users will be prompted to use the authenticator app when accessing your organization data on these devices, including email.

## Keep BYOD Macs and Windows PCs fresh

It's also important that users keep their primary work device up to date:

- Install the latest versions of Office desktop apps and keep these fresh with updates, when prompted.
- Stay on top of operating system updates, such as Windows updates.

For [unmanaged Windows and Mac devices](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md), users have the responsibility to ensure that basic security features are enabled.

### Enable basic security capabilities on BYOD Windows and Mac devices

| Windows 10 and 11 | macOS |
|:-----|:------|
|Turn on BitLocker device protection<p><p> Ensure Windows Defender remains on <p>Turn on Windows Firewall| Use FileVault to encrypt the Mac disk <p><p>Use a reliable antivirus software <p>Turn on firewall protection|

To learn more about these recommendations, see [Protect your account and devices from hackers and malware](https://support.office.com/article/Protect-your-account-and-devices-from-hackers-and-malware-066d6216-a56b-4f90-9af3-b3a1e9a327d6#ID0EAABAAA=Windows_10).

## Collaborate using Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and other tools

Your users might be tempted to share and store your organization files in places other than Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 makes it as easy as possible to collaborate and share securely. You can [share files and videos](share-files-and-videos.md) directly from Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, Stream, and even from within a file. Sharing from within these tools helps keep your data from leaking. You can add additional protection to sensitive data to prevent sharing outside your organization.

## Set up managed devices

We recommend that your most important staff members use freshly acquired Windows devices that you manage. We'll show you how to [Set up managed devices](m365bp-managed-devices-setup.md) and apply security policies to protect them.
