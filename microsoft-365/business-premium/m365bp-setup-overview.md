# Welcome to Microsoft 365 Business Premium

For this first mission, set up your initial security defenses right away. Sign in and initiate the [setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure overall security and licenses for your teams. 

Your objectives are to:

Once you've achieved these objectives, you can move on to the [next mission](m365bp-security-overview.md).
