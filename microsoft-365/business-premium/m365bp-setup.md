# Set up Microsoft 365 Business Premium

After you have [started a trial or purchased Microsoft 365 Business Premium](get-microsoft-365-business-premium.md), your next step is to get everything set up. You have several options available. You can:

- [Start with the guided setup experience](#use-the-guided-process-for-basic-setup) for basic setup and configuration; or
- [Work with a partner, such as a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](#work-with-a-microsoft-partner).

Use this article as a guide.
