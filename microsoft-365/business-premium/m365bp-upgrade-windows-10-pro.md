# Upgrade Windows devices to Windows 10 Pro

If you have Windows devices running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro, your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription entitles you to upgrade to Windows Pro 10 upgrade.  

You can choose from several methods to upgrade:

- Use Windows Update (recommended)
- Upgrade your device using the Microsoft Software Download site
- Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site

## Use Windows Update

*This option is recommended for most users, as it doesn't require users to enter a license.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that users are assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license before they follow this procedure.

1. On a Windows device, sign in using your account for Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

2. Go to Windows Update, and check for updates. If your device isn't running Windows 10 Pro, you'll be prompted to upgrade. 

## Upgrade your device using the Microsoft Software Download site
  
*Select this option if the device that you're using right now is the same device that you want to update.* 

1. Go to the [Microsoft Software Download site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836951).

2. On the **Download Windows 10** site, select **Update now** to start upgrading the device to Windows 10 Pro. 

## Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site

*Select this option to create Windows 10 installation media (USB flash drive or ISO file) that you'll use to install Windows 10 on a different device than the one you're using right now.*
    
1. Go to the [Microsoft Software Download site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836960).

2. Follow the instructions on how to use the tool and create your installation media.
