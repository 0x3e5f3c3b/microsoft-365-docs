# Upgrade Windows devices to Windows 10 Pro

If you have Windows devices running Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1 Pro, your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription entitles you to upgrade to Windows Pro 10 upgrade.  

You can choose from several methods to upgrade:

- Use Windows Update (recommended)
- Install your upgrade from the Microsoft Software Download site
- Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site

## Use Windows Update

*This option is recommended for most users.*

1. Make sure that you are assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license.

2. On a Windows device, sign in using your account for Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

3. Go to Windows Update, and check for updates. 

## Install your upgrade from the Microsoft Software Download site
  
*Select this option if the device that you're using right now is the same device that you want to update.* 

1. Go to the [Microsoft Software Download site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836951).

2. On the **Download Windows 10** site, select **Update now** to start upgrading the device to Windows 10 Pro. 

## Create installation media from the Microsoft Software Download site

*Select this option to create Windows 10 installation media (USB flash drive or ISO file) that you'll use to install Windows 10 on a different device than the one you're using right now.*
    
1. Go to the [Microsoft Software Download site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=836960).
