# Set up Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

## Overview

Welcome to your first mission. The following are enhanced security measures that are particularly useful for campaigns, but you may want to use these with any organization as part of your mission to achieve greater security.

For this first mission, you're going to set up your initial security defenses to protect and defend your organization's systems and networks. Sign in and initiate the [setup wizard](../business/set-up.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) to configure overall security and licenses for your teams. 

Your objectives are to:

- Sign up and sign in to Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Set up your Microsoft 365 Business Premium environment

Once you've achieved these objectives, you can move on to the [next mission](m365bp-security-overview.md).
