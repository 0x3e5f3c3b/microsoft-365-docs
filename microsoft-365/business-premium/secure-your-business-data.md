Microsoft 365 for business plans include security capabilities, such as antiphishing, antispam, and antimalware protection. Microsoft 365 Business Premium includes even more capabilities, such as device security, advanced threat protection, and information protection. This article lists the top 10 ways to secure your data with Microsoft 365 for business.

## Top 10 ways to secure your business data

| Task | [Microsoft 365 Business Basic](../admin/setup/setup-business-basic.md)| [Microsoft 365 Business Standard](../admin/setup/setup-business-standard.md) | [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](index.md) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **[Use multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md)**.<br/><br/>[Multi-factor authentication](../admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365.md) (MFA), also known as two-step verification, requires people to use a code or authentication app on their phone to sign into Microsoft 365, and is a critical first step to protecting your business data. Using MFA can prevent bad actors from taking over your account if they know your password. <br/><br/>Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium include [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD), which includes security defaults to simplify the process of enabling MFA. Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Azure AD Premium P1](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses), and that includes Conditional Access for more stringent requirements. <br/><br/>For more information, see [security defaults and MFA](m365bp-conditional-access.md). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free, with security defaults* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Free, with security defaults* | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>*Azure AD Premium P1, with security defaults and Conditional Access* |
| 2. **[Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md)**.<br/><br/>Administrator accounts (also called admins) have elevated privileges, making these accounts more susceptible to cyberattacks. Whether you're using Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, or Premium, you'll need to set up and manage the right number of admin and user accounts for your business. <br/><br/>We also recommend adhering to the information security principle of least privilege, which means that users and applications should be granted access only to the data and operations they require to perform their jobs. <br/><br/>For more information, see [Protect your administrator accounts](m365bp-protect-admin-accounts.md). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(Azure AD Free) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(Azure AD Free) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(Azure AD Premium P1)|
| 3. **[Use preset security policies](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Preset security policies save time by applying recommended spam, malware, and phishing policies to users all at once. <br/><br/> Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include preset security policies with recommended settings for anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing included in [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP). Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), preset security policies include advanced anti-phishing, spoof settings, impersonation settings, Safe Links, and Safe Attachments. <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Preset security policies](../security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies.md)<br/>- [Protect against malware and other cyberthreats](m365bp-increase-protection.md) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP plus Defender for Office 365 Plan 1) | 
| 4. **[Protect all devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)**.<br/><br/>Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be configured properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. Your security team and employees can all take steps to protect devices.<br/><br/>All users can use MFA on their devices. Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Premium include Microsoft 365 Apps that can be installed on computers, tablets, and phones. Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Business for securing and managing devices.<br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles:<br/>- [Secure managed and unmanaged devices](m365bp-managed-unmanaged-devices.md) <br/>- [Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices](m365bp-devices-overview.md)<br/>- [Set up and secure managed devices](m365bp-protect-devices.md) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(MFA) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(MFA and Microsoft 365 Apps)  | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(MFA, Microsoft 365 Apps, Intune, and Defender for Business) |
| 5. **[Train everyone on email best practices](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md)**.<br/><br/>Email can contain malicious attacks cloaked as harmless communications. Email systems are especially vulnerable, because email is handled by everyone in the organization, and safety relies on humans making consistently good decisions with those communications. Train everyone to know what to watch for spam or junk mail, phishing attempts, spoofing, and malware in their email. <br/><br/>Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include [Exchange Online Protection](../security/office-365-security/eop-about.md) (EOP). Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/microsoft-defender-for-office-365-product-overview#microsoft-defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), which provides additional protection for email and collaboration.<br/><br/>For more information, see [Protect yourself against phishing and other attacks](m365bp-avoid-phishing-and-attacks.md). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(EOP, advanced anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware protection, Safe Attachments, and Safe Links) | 
| 6. **[Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration and sharing](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md)**.<br/><br/>The best way to collaborate and share securely is to use Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft Teams, all your files and communications are in a protected environment and aren't being stored in unsafe ways outside of it.<br/><br/> For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Use Microsoft Teams for collaboration](create-teams-for-collaboration.md) <br/>- [Set up meetings with Microsoft Teams](set-up-meetings.md) <br/>- [Share files and videos in a safe environment](share-files-and-videos.md) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) |
| 7. **[Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](m365bp-increase-protection.md)**.<br/><br/>Your default sharing levels for SharePoint and OneDrive might be set to a more permissive level than you should use. We recommend reviewing and if necessary, changing the default settings to better protect your business. Grant people only the access they need to do their jobs. <br/><br/>For more information, see [Set sharing settings for SharePoint and OneDrive files and folders](m365bp-increase-protection.md#set-sharing-settings-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-files-and-folders). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) |
| 8. **[Use Microsoft 365 Apps on devices](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/train-your-users-on-office-and-microsoft-365-7cba3c97-7f19-46ed-a1c6-763971a26c27)**.<br/><br/>Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps (also referred to as Office apps) enable people to work productively and more securely across devices. Start a document on one device, and pick it up later on another device. Instead of sending files as email attachments, you can share links to documents that are stored in SharePoint or OneDrive.<br/><br/>Microsoft 365 Basic, Standard, and Premium include Outlook and Web/mobile versions of the Microsoft 365 Apps (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). Microsoft 365 Business Standard and Premium also include desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps. <br/><br/>For more information, see the following articles: <br/>- [Install Office apps on all devices](m365bp-install-office-apps.md).<br/>- [Train your users on Office and Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/train-your-users-on-office-and-microsoft-365-7cba3c97-7f19-46ed-a1c6-763971a26c27) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(Outlook and Web/mobile versions of Microsoft 365 Apps) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) <br/>(Outlook and Web/mobile/desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png)<br/>(Outlook and Web/mobile/desktop versions of Microsoft 365 Apps)| 
| 9. **[Manage calendar sharing for your business](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing)**.<br/><br/>You can help people in your organization share their calendars appropriately for better collaboration. You can manage what level of detail they can share, such as by limiting the details that are shared to free/busy times only. <br/><br/>For more information, see [Manage calendar sharing](m365bp-increase-protection.md#manage-calendar-sharing). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) |
| 10. **[Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md)**.<br/><br/>After your initial setup and configuration of Microsoft 365 for business is complete, your organization needs a maintenance and operations plan. As employees come and go, you'll need to add or remove users, reset passwords, and maybe even reset devices to factory settings. You'll also want to make sure people have only the access they need to do their jobs. <br/><br/>For more information, see [Maintain your environment](m365bp-maintain-environment.md). | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) | ![Included.](../media/d238e041-6854-4a78-9141-049224df0795.png) |
