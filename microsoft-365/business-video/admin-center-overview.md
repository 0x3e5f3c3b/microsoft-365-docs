# Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWfvDL?autoplay=false]

The Microsoft 365 admin center is where you manage your business in the cloud. You can complete such tasks as adding and removing users, changing licenses, and resetting passwords. 

To get to the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) or, if you're already signed in, select the app launcher, and choose **Admin**.

On the home page, you can create cards for tasks that you perform frequently. To add a new card, select **Add card**, then select the plus sign next to the card you want to add. When you are finished, close the window. You can rearrange the cards by selecting and then dragging them to where you want. To remove a card, select **More actions**, and then choose **Remove**.

To view more admin tasks, expand the navigation menu. You'll find advanced configuration settings in the additional admin centers at the bottom.

One common task that you might perform in the admin center is adding a user. To do this, select **Users**, **Active users**, and then select **Add a user**. Enter the user's name and other information, and then select **Next**. Follow the prompts to finish adding the user. When you are done, select **Finish adding**, and then select **Close**.

You can sort your active users by columns, such as **Display name** or **Licenses**. To add more columns, select **Choose columns**, select the columns you want to add, and then select **Save**.

Select a user to see more options, such as managing their product licenses.

To enable more features that come with your subscription, select **Setup**. Here you can turn on sign-in security, mobile app protection, DLP, and other features included with your subscription.

If you need support at any time, choose **Need help**. Enter your question, then check out the links that appear. If you don't get your answer here, choose **Contact support** to open a service request. 

For more information on managing billing, passwords, users, and admins, see the other lessons in this course.
