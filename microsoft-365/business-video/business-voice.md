# Overview of Business Voice

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4C56M?autoplay=false]

Microsoft 365 Business Voice provides and end-to-end cloud-based phone system for your business and its employees.

## What is Business Voice

Microsoft 365 Business Voice makes it easy for small and medium organizations to turn Microsoft Teams into a powerful and flexible telephone system. It's a replacement for traditional telephony providers and in-house phone systems that can be difficult and costly to manage. You can set up both toll and toll-free numbers, call menus to help callers get to the right department, audio conferencing so you can host meetings with anyone, and more. You can even give people their own phone numbers so they can get calls directly.

Business Voice does all of this by wrapping Microsoft 365 Phone System features into an easy-to-manage bundle. You don't need to worry about choosing the right plan or feature; they're all there and set up for you. Because Phone System is a part of Teams, you can turn any PC, Mac, or mobile device into a phone that can use your Business Voice phone number.

Business Voice goes everywhere you go because it is part of Microsoft Teams. So if you have the Teams app on your phone, tablet, or computer - you can make and receive calls with that device as if it were a physical phone in the office.
