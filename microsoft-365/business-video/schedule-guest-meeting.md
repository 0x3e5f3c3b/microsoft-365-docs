# Schedule a Teams meeting with guests

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1FOhP?autoplay=false]

You can invite people from outside of your organization to a meeting without having to add them to Microsoft Teams. Here's how it works for your customers or partners when they [join a meeting without a Teams account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c6efc38f-4e03-4e79-b28f-e65a4c039508).

## Try it!

With Microsoft Teams, you can create new teams as you start new projects or add customers.

1. On the  **Teams** tab, select **Join or create a team**, **Create team**, **Build a team from scratch**, and then **Private**.
2. Enter a name for your team, a description, and then select  **Create**.
3. On the  **Add members**  page, add internal members by searching and selecting them, and add guest members by entering their email address, and then select  **Add**.

    If you see  **We didn't find any matches** , you must enable guest sharing. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center, choose the Teams admin center, choose  **Org-wide settings**,  **Guest access** , and turn on  **Allow guest access in Teams**. This change may take up to 24 hours.

1. Select  **Close**. Your guests and members will receive invitations to the team.
2. On the General channel, enter a greeting for everyone and select  **Send**.
3. On the  **Files** tab, add documents that you want to work on together. You can create them here or drag and drop files from your computer.
