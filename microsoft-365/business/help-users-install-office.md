# Help your users install Office on Windows 10 devices

[![Label to let you know the admin center is changing and you can find more details at aka.ms/aboutM365preview.](media/m365admincenterchanging.png)](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview)

You can quickly and easily install Office on Windows 10 PCs from the Microsoft 365 Business admin center.
  
To understand how this works with previously installed Office apps, read [Prepare for Office client installation](prepare-for-office-client-deployment.md) before you get started. 
  
## Manage Office deployments

1. Go to the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>, and sign in with global admin credentials. 

2. Go to **Setup** in the left navigation pane, and on the **Setup** page, scroll to **Apps and updates**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You might not see this card if all of your  users have installed Office apps.
  
3. On the **Help users install their Office apps** card, choose **View**, and then **Get started**.
    
4. On the **Email users a link to download Office** panel, select the users you want to email, and then **Email selected users**.
