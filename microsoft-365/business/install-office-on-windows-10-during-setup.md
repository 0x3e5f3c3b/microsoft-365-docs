# Install Office on Windows 10 during setup

![Banner that point to https://aka.ms/aboutM365preview.](media/m365admincenterchanging.png)

This setting is off by default. You can turn it on to ensure that users have the latest version of Office running on all their Windows 10 devices, but should first verify that all prerequisites are met. Users have to be licensed for Microsoft 365 Business for this setting to push the software to the device in addition to other requirements described in [Prepare for Office client deployment by Microsoft 365 Business](prepare-for-office-client-deployment.md). 
  
We recommend you accept the default setting during setup. If you want to have different settings for different groups of users, you can manage Office deployment on a group-by-group basis after setup. Go to **Devices** \> **Manage Office deployment** from the Admin center home. For step-by-step directions, see [Automatically install or uninstall Office on Windows 10 devices](auto-install-or-uninstall-office.md).
