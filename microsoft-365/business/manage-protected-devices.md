# Manage protected devices with Microsoft 365 Business

After a user connects their device to your organization, by signing in with their work account to the device or to Office apps on the device, we're able to protect the device with the policies that you set up and it will be listed on the **Devices** page. If a device is lost or stolen, you can manage it from this page to remove any company data. You can also reset Windows 10 devices to their factory settings to wipe out any custom settings. For more information on the tasks you can perform to manage devices, please see these articles:
