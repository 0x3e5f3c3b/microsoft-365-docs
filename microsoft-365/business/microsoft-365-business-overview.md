Your business data can be compromised in many ways. You and your users can compromise your organization's security when you sign in with compromised credentials or view organization data on different devices and applications. More specifically, your organization is at risk from:

1. Compromised or weak sign-in credentials.
2. Compromised device with a weak pin, or a user owned device.
3. Users who can copy/paste/save your organization's data to personal apps​.
4. Users who install and use 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps with weak security​.
5. Email vulnerabilities including sharing sensitive data, phishing attempts, malware, etc.
6. When people who should not, can access documents with sensitive information.

Microsoft 365 Business helps safeguard your data in each of these instances. The security features that protect your business data are detailed in the following figure.
