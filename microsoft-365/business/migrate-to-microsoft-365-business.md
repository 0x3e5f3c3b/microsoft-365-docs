# Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business from Office 365 Business Premium

If you have an Office 365 for business subscription, for example, Office 365 Business Premium, you can easily add licenses for Microsoft 365 Business, and assign them to some, or all users. Add licenses for Microsoft 365 Business if you want to add: 
- Windows 10 Pro (to PCs running Windows 8 or later)
- Simple controls that manage business data on devices
- Advanced security capabilities.
Find out more at about Microsoft 365 Business [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business)

## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business yourself, or get help

You have three ways to get Microsoft 365 Business:
 - [Add Microsoft 365 Business licenses](#add-microsoft-365-business-licenses) and assign them yourself by following the steps in this topic.
 - [Add a Microsoft partner](get-microsoft-365-business.md) to your Office 365 subscription. The partner can purchase licenses for you and help you transition.
 - [Head to a Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/locations/find-a-store) where they can complete the process for you.
  
## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business
Buy your licenses by following these steps in the [new admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview):
1. Sign into the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
2. Go to the navigation pane and select **Billing** \> **Products & Services**. Find your Office 365 subscription and select it to view the details. (pic)
3. On the next page, select **Upgrade** (pic) to view a list of Office plans that you can choose from. Find the Microsoft 365 Business plan. You can scroll down if you want to see all the Office apps and services that are included with this plan. Under Microsoft 365 Business, select **Upgrade** to add Microsoft 365 Business to your cart.
4. In the cart:
    1. We'll automatically include licenses for all your current users to the cart. Adjust the quantity of licenses if you want to purchase more or less. For example, buy less licenses if you want some of your users to continue with their current plan. Everyone in your organization continues with their current license until you [assign a different license](#assign-microsoft-365-licenses). 
    2. You can adjust how you'd like to pay - monthly or yearly. Select the drop-down menu to make your choice.
5. Select **Go to Checkout** where you'll see a summary of your purchase, including the payment method details for this account. You can also add a promo code here if you have one.
6. Select **Place order** to complete your purchase.
It takes Microsoft a few minutes to set up your new service plans so you can assign licenses to your employees. To check on progress, select **Check upgrade status**. 
1. Once your plan is ready, select **Go to setup** and follow the steps in [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses](#assign-microsoft-365-licenses).
  
## Assign Microsoft 365 licenses

Once you have purchased new licenses, select **Assign to Users** to open the **Active users** page. The page shows the current license assigned to each user. Follow the procedure for the change you want to make. Change licenses either for:
- [All users](#assign-licenses-to-all-users)
- [A specific group](#assign-licenses-to-a-specific-group) (if you have those set up).
- [Individual users](#assign-licenses-to-individual-users)

> [!NOTE]
> You'll receive a prorated refund for the licenses that you no longer need. Your bank account or credit card will be charged about two days after you set up the new plan.

### Assign licenses to all users
1. On the **Active users** page, select the checkmark to the left of **Display name** to select all users.
2. Select **Manage product licenses** to open the side pane. Then select **Replace existing license assignments**.
3. Select **Next** to view the **Replace existing products** page. Next to Microsoft 365 Business, switch the toggle to **Yes** to assign licenses to all users. All the features included with Microsoft 365 are automatically switched on too. We recommend leaving all features switched on unless there are specific options that you don't want to make available to everyone - for example - you might not need [Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/yammer-landing-page), especially in a very small business. If you switch something off now, you can add it back later. 
4. Select **Replace** and then **Close** to complete this change. 

### Assign licenses to a specific group
On the **Active users** page, select **Assign to group** and then follow the instructions for [Assign licenses to all users](#assign-licenses-to-all-users).

### Assign licenses to individual users
On the **Active users** page, select a user, to open their details in the side pane. Select **Licenses and Apps** and then select **Microsoft 365 Business** to switch the individual license.

## Protect user devices and files

After you have assigned Microsoft 365 Business licenses, complete steps to start protecting devices and files. You'll be using some new options included in the navigation pane.
  
1. In the admin center, in the navigation pane, go to **Devices** \> **Policies**.
    
2. On the **Device policies** page, select **Add**.
    
3. In the **Add policy** pane give the policy a name (for example, Protect work files), and then choose a **Policy type** from the drop-down. 
    
    You can set up application policies for protecting files on Android and iPhone devices, as well as Windows 10, and you can set up device configuration policies for company owned Windows 10 devices. See the following links for details:
    
  - [Set app protection settings for Android or iOS devices](app-protection-settings-for-android-and-ios.md)
    
  - [Set application protection settings for Windows 10 devices](protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md)
    
  - [Set device protection settings for Windows 10 PCs](protection-settings-for-windows-10-pcs.md)
    
  
4. After you set up policies, you and your employees can set up devices:
    
  - If your Windows devices aren't already using the Windows Pro Creator update, you'll need to [upgrade them to Windows Pro Creators Update](upgrade-to-windows-pro-creators-update.md).
    
  - See [Set up Windows devices for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-windows-devices.md) for steps for Windows devices.
