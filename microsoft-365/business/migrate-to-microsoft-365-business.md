# Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business from Office 365 Business Premium

If you have an Office 365 for business subscription, for example, Office 365 Business Premium, you can easily upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business. Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business if you want to add: 
- Windows 10 Pro (to PCs running Windows 8 or later)
- Simple controls that manage business data on devices
- Advanced security capabilities.
Find out more about Microsoft 365 Business at [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business)

## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business yourself, or get help

You have three ways to upgrade your current plan to Microsoft 365 Business:
 - [Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business in the admin center](#add-microsoft-365-business-licenses) and complete the process yourself by following the steps in this topic. You can try the steps out, and until you select **Place order** in step 7 below, you can back out at any time.
 - [Add a Microsoft partner](get-microsoft-365-business.md) to your Office 365 subscription. The partner can purchase licenses for you and help you transition.
 - [Head to a Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/locations/find-a-store) where they can complete the process for you.
  
## When should I use upgrade?

Upgrade is the right choice when you want to upgrade **all users** assigned to a single plan. When you use upgrade, all the users get switched to another plan at the same time. If you don't want to upgrade everyone assigned to a single plan, buy licenses for the new plan (in this case Microsoft 365 Business), and [assign those licenses individually](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) to each person that you want to upgrade.   

## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Business
Buy your licenses by following these steps in the [new admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview):
1. Sign into the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>.
2. Go to the navigation pane and select **Billing** \> **Products & Services**. Find your Office 365 subscription and select it to view the details.

3. On the next page, select **Upgrade**.

  Next you can view a list of Office plans that you can upgrade to from your current plan. Find the Microsoft 365 Business plan. You can scroll down if you want to see all the Office apps and services that are included with this plan. Under **Microsoft 365 Business**, select **Upgrade** to add Microsoft 365 Business to your cart.
4. In the cart:
    1. We'll automatically include licenses for all your current users to the cart. Adjust the quantity of licenses if you want to purchase more or less. For example, buy less licenses if you want some of your users to continue with their current plan. Everyone in your organization continues with their current license until you [assign a different license](#assign-microsoft-365-licenses). 
    2. You can adjust how you'd like to pay - monthly or yearly. Select the drop-down menu to make your choice.
5. Select **Go to Checkout** where you'll see a summary of your purchase, including the payment method details for this account. You can also add a promo code here if you have one.
6. Select **Place order** to complete your purchase.
It takes Microsoft a few minutes to set up your new service plans. To check on progress, select **Check upgrade status**. 
7. Once your plan is ready, select **Go to setup** and follow the steps in [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses](#assign-microsoft-365-licenses).

> [!NOTE]
> You'll receive a prorated refund for the licenses that you no longer need. Your bank account or credit card will be charged about two days after you set up the new plan.
  
## Protect user devices and files

Now that Microsoft 365 Business licenses have been assigned, complete steps to start protecting devices and files. You'll be using some new options included in the navigation pane.
  
1. In the admin center, in the navigation pane, go to **Devices** \> **Policies**.
    
2. On the **Device policies** page, select **Add**.
    
3. In the **Add policy** pane give the policy a name (for example, Protect work files), and then choose a **Policy type** from the drop-down. 
    
    You can set up application policies for protecting files on Android and iPhone devices, as well as Windows 10, and you can set up device configuration policies for company owned Windows 10 devices. See the following links for details:
    
  - [Set app protection settings for Android or iOS devices](app-protection-settings-for-android-and-ios.md)
    
  - [Set application protection settings for Windows 10 devices](protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md)
    
  - [Set device protection settings for Windows 10 PCs](protection-settings-for-windows-10-pcs.md)
    
  
4. After you set up policies, you and your employees can set up devices:
    
  - If your Windows devices aren't already using the Windows Pro Creator update, you'll need to [upgrade them to Windows Pro Creators Update](upgrade-to-windows-pro-creators-update.md).
    
  - See [Set up Windows devices for Microsoft 365 Business users](set-up-windows-devices.md) for steps for Windows devices.
