# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Business

Go to [Discover Microsoft 365 Business advantage](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business#pmg-cmp-desktop) and choose **Buy Now** under Microsoft 365 Business.

1. On the **Welcome, let's get to know you** page enter the required information. Note that 
 
    -  The **Country** you choose determines the service you are getting and can't be changed later.
    - The **Business email address** is any email you have and will be used by Microsoft to send you correspondence about your subscription.
    - The **Company name** will be displayed in the admin center, and used for any SharePoint site URLs.

2. On the **Create your user ID** page, enter the alias you want to use to sign in, a domain name after the @ sign, and then select a domain from the drop-down. You can use this to purchase a domain and select the extension from the dropdown, for example, you can enter *Teresa@ContosoSkis.net* and the wizard will determine if the domain is available and add the cost to your Microsoft 365 Business cost. The new domain will also be set up for you and ready to use if you purchase it here.

    If you have an existing domain you want to use, choose *.onmicrosoft.com* from the drop down, and you can set it up later in the admin center.
