# Sign up for Microsoft 365 Business

If you are a partner, see [Get Microsoft 365 Business from Microsoft Partner Center](get-microsoft-365-business.md#get-microsoft-365-business-from-microsoft-partner-center).

To purchase Microsoft 365 Business online, go to [Discover Microsoft 365 Business advantage](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business#pmg-cmp-desktop) and choose **Buy Now** under Microsoft 365 Business.

You can also head over to a [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store?icid=en-us_UF_FAS) to both buy Microsoft 365 Business and get set-up help.

## Complete the sign-up steps

After you have purchased Microsoft 365 Business, complete the following steps.

1. On the **Welcome, let's get to know you** page enter the required information. Note that:
 
    -  **Country or regions:** This determines the service you receive and can't be changed later.
    - **Business email address:** Enter your current email address. Microsoft uses this address to correspond with you about your Microsoft 365 subscription.
    - **Company name** We'll display your company name in the admin center; this is where you'll manage Microsoft 365 users, licenses, and so on. We'll also include it in any SharePoint site URLs.

2. On the **Create your user ID** page:

    - **Username**: Enter the name (called an alias) that you'll use for your own business email. For example, Robert Young might use RobY or RobYoung as a work alias.
    - **Your company**: Enter your unique business name. This is the name that your business web site uses if you have one, and is also the name you want to include after the @ sign when you receive a business email. This name is called a domain. For example, if your business is called Contoso Skis, enter ContosoSkis after the @ sign.
    - **Select a domain**: If you own your domain name already, select .onmicrosoft.com from the drop down menu and we'll ask you to set it up later. Otherwise, it's easy to buy a domain name that represents your business. To do that, select the domain you prefer from the drop down menu. For example, your full email address might be *Teresa@ContosoSkis.net*. We'll let you know right away if the domain name is available. If it is, we'll add the cost of your domain to the cost of your Microsoft 365 Business subscription. The new domain will also be set up and ready for use in Microsoft 365 if you purchase it here. For information about domains, see [Domains FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/domains-faq).

For more information about taxes, see [What tax will I be charged?](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/what-tax-will-i-be-charged?view=o365-worldwide) 
1. Select **Next**, review your order and select **Next** again.

    You can then go to the [admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/what-tax-will-i-be-charged?view=o365-worldwide) to finish your [set up](set-up.md).
