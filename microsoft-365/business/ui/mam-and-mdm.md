# Difference between MDM and MAM

Microsoft 365 Business offers number of ways for you to protect your business data. In [Overview of Microsoft 365 Business](../microsoft-365-business-overview.md) you can read more about the various protections that are automatically set up, and what you can set up yourself to further protect your business. You can also set up policies that protect your Windows 10 devices, and well as the data in your mobile devices.
[Set application protection settings for Windows 10 devices](../protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md)
## Mobile device management or MDM

Microsoft 365 Business allows you to set up policies that protect data on your Windows 10 devices. When a device is under mobile device management, you control the entire device, and can wipe data from it, as well as reset it to factory settings. See [Set device protection settings for Windows 10 PCs](../protection-settings-for-windows-10-pcs.md) for more information.

## Mobile application management or MAM

Mobile application management allows you to control your business data in your users' personal devices, such as iPhones and Androids, as well as their personal Win 10 computers. The application management policies you set enable you to keep your users copying business data from Office apps to their personal apps, and you can also remove all data from the Office apps on their personal devices. See [Set app protection settings for Android or iOS devices](../app-protection-settings-for-android-and-ios.md) and [Set application protection settings for Windows 10 devices](../protection-settings-for-windows-10-devices.md) for more information.
