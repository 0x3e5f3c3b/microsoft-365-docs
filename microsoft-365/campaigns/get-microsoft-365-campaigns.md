## What does it cost, who needs it, and what is the commitment?
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns costs $5 per user per month. 
To protect your campaign or business, we recommend a license for the candidate, all senior staff who are part of the campaign or party including the campaign manager, and usually all full-time staff.
