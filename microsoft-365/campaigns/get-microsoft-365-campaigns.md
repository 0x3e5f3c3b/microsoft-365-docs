# Microsoft 365 for Campaigns
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns helps you run your campaign while keeping your information secure. We help you stay connected to your team, and simple controls help you secure your email,devices, and content. 

Campaigns and political parties in the USA are eligible for this campaign:
- US Federal political campaigns (for example, campaigns seeking office for the US House, US Senate, or President)
- National-level political parties in the United States.

If your campaign or political party needs cybersecurity protection, this is the Microsoft plan for you.  
 This topic has details about: 
- What the plan includes, how much it costs, and what your commitment is
- How to get started

## What does it include?
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns helps you and your campaign staff work to together 

## What does it cost, who needs it, and what is the commitment?
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns costs $5 per user per month. 
To protect your campaign or business, we recommend a license for the candidate, all senior staff who are part of the campaign or party including the campaign manager, and usually all full-time staff. Very strategic volunteer employees might also need a license. In general, anyone who needs protected email and devices should have a license.
There is no commitment. You can pay monthly for the licenses you need and stop using the service any time.

## How to get Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

1. Provide some details about your organization at https://m365forcampaigns.microsoft.com/. There's no commitment when you complete this form. The details you provide will help us verify that eligibility and that you're based in the United States.
2. After you've completed the form, it takes us a few days to check that you're eligible Microsoft 365 for Campaigns. 
3. Once we've verified your details, you'll receive an email from Microsoft that includes a sign-up location and code specific to your organization. 

## Sign up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

Before you start, you'll need the email from Microsoft with a code for your organization, and your business credit card. 

> [!TIP]
> The code we sent is unique to you. It only works once. Make sure you have enough time to complete sign-up. It takes about ten minutes. 

1. Select the link in your email
2. **On the Microsoft 365 Business page**, enter your business details. In the Business email address filed, use your current email address. We only need address to stay in touch with you during the setup process. Select Next.
3. **On the Create your user ID page**:
 - Enter the username or alias you want to use as part of your email address. For example, you might just want to be known as Alice or Rob. In a larger campaign, you might need to include your last name such as AliceChavez.
 - In Yourcompany, enter the name of the campaign you work for. For example, your campaign might be called ContosoCampaign. You can enter that in Yourcompany. 
 - In Select a domain, use .onmicrosoft.com for now. We can get you set up with a domain later, or get you connected to a domain that you already own. However, if your campaign or party doesn't own a domain and you are sure what domain you want, you can buy one now by selecting it.
 - Create a password and select **Create my account**.
