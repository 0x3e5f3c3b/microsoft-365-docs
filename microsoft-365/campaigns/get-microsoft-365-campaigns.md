# Get Microsoft 365 for Campaigns

Campaigns and political parties in the USA are eligible for this plan. Currently this plan is available to:
- US federal political campaigns (for example, campaigns seeking office for the US House, US Senate, or President)
- National-level political parties in the United States.

If your campaign or political party needs cybersecurity protection for email and devices, this is the Microsoft plan for you. This is the least expensive plan available through Microsoft.  

## What does Microsoft 365 for Campaigns include?
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns helps you and your campaign staff work together securely. The plan includes Microsoft 365 Business at a discounted price, and includes simple controls that: 
- **Protect user identity**: Make sure users are who they say they are when they sign in to send email or to access files (multifactor authentication)
- **Protect sensitive information**: Protect sensitive information to monitor information that gets shared outside your organization (data loss prevention)
- **Protect mobile devices**: Protect data on mobile devices (mobile app protection policy)
- **Guard against malicious content**: Prevent access to malicious content by scanning email attachments (advanced threat protection)
- **Protect passwords**: Set passwords to never expire which is more secure and helps prevent work stoppages (password policy) 


## What does it cost, who needs it, and what is the commitment?
Microsoft 365 for Campaigns costs $5 per user per month. 
To protect your campaign, we recommend a license for the candidate, the campaign manager, all senior staff who are part of the campaign or party, and usually all full-time staff. Certain volunteer employees might also need a license. In general, anyone who needs protected email and devices should have a license.
There is no minimum time commitment when you sign up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns. You can pay monthly for the licenses you need and stop using the service any time.
