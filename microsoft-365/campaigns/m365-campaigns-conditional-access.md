# Configure conditional access policies for Microsoft 365 for campaigns

You can use conditional access to add substancial additional security in addition to signing in with a user name and password. You can add policies to require second form of authentication (called multifactor authentication, or MFA), give differing access based on the device, or whether the app is a cloud app or a client app, restrict access to IP addresses that you control. You can even block certain users from accessing resources. For more see, [overview of conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).

**Recommended conditional access policies for Microsoft 365 for campaigns**
- Set up baseline conditional access policies
    - Require MFA for all users
    - Require approved apps
    - Block clients that don't support modern authentication
- Set up app protection policies (one policy per platform--iOS, Android)
