# Protect unmanaged Windows 10 PCs and Macs

## Protect a computer running Windows 10 or a Mac

The following are specific things you can do if your computer is running Windows 10, or if you have a Mac.

## [Windows 10](#tab/Windows10)
**Turn on device encryption**<p>
Device encryption is available on a wide range of Windows devices and helps protect your data by encrypting it. If you turn on device encryption, only authorized individuals will be able to access your device and data. If device encryption is not available on your device, you can turn on standard BitLocker encryption instead. (BitLocker is not available on Windows 10 Home edition.)

**Protect your device with Windows Security**<p>
If you have Windows 10, you’ll get the latest antivirus protection with Windows Security. When you start up Windows 10 for the first time, Windows Security is on and actively helping to protect your PC by scanning for malware (malicious software), viruses, and security threats. Windows Security uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC.

Windows Update downloads updates for Windows Security automatically to help keep your PC safe and protect it from threats.

If you have an earlier version of Windows and are using Microsoft Security Essentials, it’s a good idea to move to Windows Security.

**Turn on Windows Firewall**<p>
You should always run Windows Firewall even if you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your device (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to unauthorized access.

## [Mac](#tab/Mac)
**Use FileVault to encrypt your Mac disk**<p>
Disk encryption protects data when devices are lost or stolen. FileVault full-disk encryption helps prevent unauthorized access to the information on your startup disk

**Protect your mac from malware**<p>
Microsoft recommends you install and use reliable antivirus software on your Mac.

You can also reduce the risk of malware by using software only from reliable sources. The settings in Security & Privacy preferences allow you to specify the sources of software installed on your Mac.

**Turn on firewall protection**<p>
Use firewall settings to protect your Mac from unwanted contact initiated by other computers when you’re connected to the Internet or a network. Without this protection your Mac might be more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
