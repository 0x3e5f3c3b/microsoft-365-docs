# Sign up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns 

Before you start: 
- Get your invite to to Microsoft 365 for Campaigns by completing the steps in [Get Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](get-microsoft-365-campaigns.md) 
- Have your email invitation to hand. The invite from Microsoft has a unique sign-up link for your organization. You'll need this to get the special pricing.
- Have your business credit card and a phone to hand. 

> [!TIP]
> The link we sent is unique to your campaign. It only works once, so make sure you have enough time to complete sign-up. You'll need about ten minutes. 

## Steps to sign up 

1. In your Invitation to Microsoft 365 for Campaigns email, select **Click To Enroll Your Organization**. This triggers Microsoft 365 sign-up to begin.
2. **On the Microsoft 365 Business page**, enter your business details. In **Business email address** field, use your current email address. We only need this address to stay in touch with you during the setup process. Select **Next**.
3. **On the Create your user ID page**:
    1. Enter the username or alias you want for your email address. For example, you might just want to be known as Alice or Rob. In a larger campaign, include your last name such as AliceChavez.
    2. In **Yourcompany**, enter the name of the campaign you work for. For example, ContosoCampaign. If you already own a domain, use that name here. 
    3. In **Select a domain**, select **.onmicrosoft.com** for now. We can set you up with a domain later, or get Microsoft 365 connected to a domain that you already own.
    4. Create a password and select **Create my account**. 
> [!NOTE]
> If your campaign or party doesn't own a domain, and you have decided what domain you want, you can buy one now by selecting it.

4. **Prove. You're. Not. A. Robot. page**:
    1. Have your phone ready, and select **Text me** (or **Call me** if you prefer). Then enter your phone number. 
    2. When you select **Text me**, we'll send you a verification code. Or we'll call you with a code if you select **Call me**.
    3. Enter the code from your text message (or call) and select **Next**. Next, expect a short wait. 
5. **Where will you be using this page**: Enter your primary work location details and phone number. Select **Next**.
6. **How does this look page**:
    1. Verify the cost per user is $5.00. If the cost per user is not $5, we recommend calling support.
    2. If you only want to set yourself up for now, select **Next**. 
    3. Optional: Add some extra licensed users now by changing the number in the **user** field. [The staff you work with can be added to Microsoft 365](../business/add-users-m365b.md?toc=/microsoft-365/campaigns/toc.json) at any time.
7. **How do you want to pay? page**: Select **New credit card**, enter your business credit card details, and select **Place order**. It's also possible to use a bank account if you prefer that option.
8. **This may take a moment page**: You'll find detais about where to sign in and your user ID. We'll also send these details to the email address that you entered during step 2 above.

Your Microsoft 365 for Campaigns sign-up is complete. If you want to continue with the next steps, select **Start Setup**, or come back later to finish the steps. When you're ready, check your email to find your user name and password so you can log in again. We sent your user name and password to the email address you entered in step 2. These are called your admin or global admin credentials.
