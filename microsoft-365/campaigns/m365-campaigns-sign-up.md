# Sign up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns 

Before you start: 
- Complete the steps in [Microsoft 365 for Campaigns](get-microsoft-365-campaigns.md) 
- Makes sure you have your email invitation from Microsoft with a unique sign-up link for your organization
- Have your business credit card and a phone to hand. 

> [!TIP]
> The link we sent is unique to your campaign. It only works once, so make sure you have enough time to complete sign-up. You'll need about ten minutes. 

## Steps to sign-up for Microsoft 365 for Campaigns 

1. Find your Invitation to Microsoft 365 for Campaigns email. In the email, select **Click To Enroll Your Organization**. This triggers Microsoft 365 sign-up to begin.
2. **On the Microsoft 365 Business page**, enter your business details. In the **Business email address** field, use your current email address. We only need this address to stay in touch with you during the setup process. Select **Next**.
3. **On the Create your user ID page**:
    1. Enter the username or alias you want for your email address. For example, you might just want to be known as Alice or Rob. In a larger campaign, include your last name such as AliceChavez.
    2. In **Yourcompany**, enter the name of the campaign you work for. For example, ContosoCampaign. If you already own a domain, use that name here. 
    3. In **Select a domain**, select **.onmicrosoft.com** for now. We can set you up with a domain later, or get Microsoft 365 connected to a domain that you already own.
> [!NOTE]
> If your campaign or party doesn't own a domain, and you have already decided what domain you want, you can buy one now by selecting it.
    d. Create a password and select **Create my account**. 
4. **On the Prove. You're. Not. A. Robot. page**:
    1. Have your phone ready, and select **Text me** (or **Call me** if you prefer). Then enter your phone number. 
    2. When you select **Text me**, we'll send you a verification code. Or we'll call you with a code if you select **Call me**.
    3. Enter the code from your text message (or call) and select **Next**. Next, expect a short wait. 
5. **On the Where will you be using this page**, enter your primary work location details and phone number. Select **Next**.
6. **On the How does this look page**:
    1. Verify the cost per user is $5.00. If the cost per user is not $5, we recommend calling support.
    2. If you only want to set yourself up for now, select Next. 
    3. Optional: Add some extra licensed users now by changing the number in the **user** field. Extra users can be set up any time.
7. **On the How do you want to pay? page** select **New credit card**, enter your business credit card details, and select **Place order**. It's also possible to use a bank account if you prefer that option.
8. **On the This may take a moment page** you'll see detais about where to sign in and your user ID. We'll also send these details to the email address that you entered during step 2 above.
Your Microsoft 365 for Campaigns sign-up is complete. 
9. If you want to continue with the next steps, select **Start Setup**, or come back later to finish the steps under What's next? 

## What's next?
We recommend completing these tasks next:
1. Connect Microsoft 365 to a domain you own or want to buy
2. Complete security setup for your campaign
    a. **Multifactor authentication**: make sure users are who they say they are when they sign in 
    b. **Data loss prevention:** Protect sensitive information by monitoring information that gets shared outside your organization 
    c. **Mobile app protection policy** Protect data on on mobile devices 
    d. **Advanced threat protection:** Prevent users from accessing malicious content by scanning attachements
    e. **Password policy** Set passwords to never expire which is more secure and helps prevent work stoppages
3. Add licenses for the candidate, all senior campaign staff, and for anyone who will have access to sensitive campaign or party information.
