# How Microsoft 365 for campaigns affects your users

Microsoft 365 for campaigns makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your environment. The tradeoff is your users will need to be aware of how to work within this more secure environment. We understand a little extra patience is required, but it's worth it to keep your organization protected.

![Illustration that sums up key points from below for iPhones, Android devices, Macs, Windows 10, sharing, and key staff](../images/campaigns/M365-campaigns-Users_700px.png)

## Set up iPhones and Android devices
All users you add to your environment will need to take a few minutes to setup iPhones and Android devices to work securely:
- Setup devices to use multi-factor authentication with the autenticator app.
- Use Microsoft mobile apps, including Outlook Mobile, Word, OneDrive, and other Microsoft apps from the app store. The native mail apps that are included on iPhones and Android devices are not supported. 

After setting these up, your users will be prompted to use the authenticator app when accessing your organization data on these devices, indluding mail. 

## Keep BYOD Macs and Windows 10 PCs fresh 
It's also important that users keep their primary work device up to date:
- Install the latest versions of Office desktop apps and keep these fresh with updates, when prompted. 
- Stay on top of operating system updates, such as Windows updates.

For unmanaged Windows 10 and Mac devices, users have the responsibility to ensure basic security features are enabled.

## Collaborate using Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and other Office 365 tools
Your users might be tempted to share and store your organization files in places other than Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 makes it as easy as possible to collaborate and share securely. You can share files and videos directly from Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, Stream, and even from within a file. Sharing from within these tools helps keep your data from leaking. You can also add additional protection to sensitive data to prevent sharing outside your organization. 


## Setting up managed Windows 10 devices
We recommend your most important staff members use freshly aquired Windows 10 devices that you manage. We'll show you how to manage and secure these devices. This ensures that staff members that are the highest value target to hackers receive the most protection.
