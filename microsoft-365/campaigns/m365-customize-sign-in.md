# Customize your sign-in page

You can customize your sign-in page with your branding, and you can also add text to help your users sign in, or to point out legal requirements or restrictions for getting access to Microsoft 365 for campaigns resources.

## Customize the text on your sign-in page

To update the customizable elements on the sign-in you have to be a global admin. For specific instructions, see [add company branding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding) article.

The elements you can update are:
- Sing-in page background image
- Banner logo
- Username hint
- Sign-in page text

The following text is an example legal disclaimer text for the sign-in page:

*This service belongs to the Contoso campaign and may be only used by authorized staff and affiliates. The service usage may be monitored to ensure network security, or in response to misuse allegations. The Contoso campaign reserves the right to disclose the results of any monitoring to law enforcement if it deems such disclosure to be appropriate.*
