# Understand your invoice for Microsoft 365 for business

Your invoice provides a summary of charges for your subscription and includes instructions for how to make a payment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have other subscriptions instead of or in addition to Microsoft 365, see Understand your bill or invoice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of January 26, 2021, new bank accounts are no longer supported for customers in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. If you’re an existing customer in one of those countries, you can continue paying for your subscription with an existing bank account, and you can add new subscriptions to it, but only as long as the bank account is in good standing.

## How often and when am I billed?

Depending on the billing frequency you chose when you bought your subscription, you receive an invoice either monthly or annually. If you chose annual billing, you only receive one invoice a year, unless activity for your subscription adds a new charge or a credit. 

The amount of time since the last invoice date is called the Billing Period and is on page one of the invoice. This time represents the date range during which charges accrue for the current invoice. If you made a change to your subscription outside of this date range, like adding or removing licenses or canceling a subscription, the associated charges appear on the invoice for the next Billing Period. 

Starting on page two of the invoice, you see the charges grouped by their Service Period. The Service Period is the date range during which you're charged to use the service.

At the end of each Billing Period, you receive an email that says your new invoice is ready to view or download in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have more than one order, you receive an invoice for each order. Learn how to find and view your bill or invoice.

## Overview of the invoice .PDF

Your invoice contains at least two pages. Page one is the billing summary, and contains general information about the invoice, order, amount due, and payment instructions, if applicable.

## Why is my total due different from last month?

The amount billed for your subscription reflects the license price multiplied by the number of licenses purchased and any required taxes or fees.

If the amount billed is different than expected, there are a few reasons this can happen:

- Licenses were added or removed from your subscription. When licenses are changed mid-term, this is reflected on the next invoice. You might see a credit and re-bill for the previous Service Period to account for this change.
- The subscription was cancelled. You will receive an invoice after cancellation with any outstanding balance minus any credits.
- Your subscription renewed for a new term and the license price changed.

## Invoice sections

### Header

The header appears at the top of every invoice page, and includes the month of service, and the Invoice Date, which is the date Microsoft created the invoice. The invoice is created the day after the end of your Billing Period. For example, if your Billing Period is Jan 15 - Feb 14, your Invoice Date is Feb 15.

The header also includes an Invoice Number, the unique number assigned to your invoice. If you pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or check, please reference the Invoice Number with your payment.

Finally, the header includes the Due Date for payment of the invoice, and the total amount owed. If your subscription is paid with a credit card or bank account, we charge your credit card or banking account the day after the Invoice Date.

### Footer

The footer appears at the bottom of every invoice page. It includes the phone number to call for billing or technical support, a link to online self-help articles, and the address and tax ID for Microsoft in your country or region.

### Page one

Page one of your invoice contains address information for your organization, high-level details about your order, a summary of invoice totals, and instructions about how to pay your invoice.

#### Addresses

Three addresses appear at the top of the first page. Sold-To is the name and address of the entity that bought the subscription. Bill-To is the address of your billing department. Service Usage Address is the address where the service is used. Usually, these addresses are the same. Depending on the size and configuration of your organization, these addresses might be different.

To update the Sold-To address, see Change your organization's address, technical contact email, and other information. To update your Bill-To  or Service Usage Address, see Change your billing addresses.

#### Order Details

On page one of your invoice, the Product is "Online Services,” the generic term used to describe your subscription. Page two lists the individual product name.

Customer PO Number is the purchase order (PO) number that you specify. You can't add a PO number to an existing invoice. If you update the PO number, it’s included in future invoices. To change the PO number, see Change your purchase order number.

Order Number is the globally unique identifier (GUID) that identifies your order. Every time you buy a new subscription, a new order with a new order number is created. You receive an invoice for each order every billing period.

Billing Period is the period since the last invoice date.

Payment Terms is the number of days from the Invoice Date when payment is due. The standard term is 30 days.

Due Date is the date when the invoice payment is due. If your subscription is paid with a credit card or bank account, we charge your credit card or banking account the day after the Invoice Date.

#### Billing Summary

Page one of your invoice shows the totals of the following items for the invoice Billing Period. Page two contains details for each category.

- Charges
- Discounts
- Credits
- Tax
- Total
- Payment Instructions

If you pay by credit card, you see "Please DO NOT PAY. You will be charged the amount due through your selected method of payment." If you pay by invoice, this section contains instructions for paying by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or check.

#### Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT)

If you chose "invoice" as the subscription payment method, page one contains the Microsoft bank account information for electronic payments (wire, ACH, SEPA, etc.). Usually, your bank has a reference field you complete when you send a payment. Please reference the invoice number in that field.

#### Check (?)

#### Support

The Support section includes instructions on how to view past invoices in the Microsoft 365 admin center. It also includes a link to self-help articles, and the support phone number for your country or region.

### Page two

The product name for your subscription is at the top of page two. Below it is an explanation for how the charges are calculated.

#### New charges

The New charges section shows the Service Period during which charges, discounts, credits, and taxes were added. It shows the number of licenses included during the service period, the price per license, and the number of days in the service period.

#### Previous charges

The Previous charges section shows a credit for charges you paid for from the previous invoice.

#### Charges during this billing period

The Charges during this billing period section shows changes to your subscription made during the billing period. This might be licenses that were added or removed from your subscription. The charges or refunds owed to you because of those changes are prorated for the number of days affected during the billing period.
