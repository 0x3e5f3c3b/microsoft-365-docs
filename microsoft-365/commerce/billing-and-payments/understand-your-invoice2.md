# Understand your bill or invoice for Microsoft 365 for business

Your bill or invoice provides a summary of charges for your subscription and includes instructions for how to make a payment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have other subscriptions instead of or in addition to Microsoft 365, see [Understand your bill or invoice](understand-your-invoice.md).

## How often and when am I billed?

Depending on the billing frequency you chose when you bought your subscription, you receive an invoice either monthly or annually. If you chose annual billing, you only receive one invoice a year, unless activity for your subscription adds a new charge or a credit.

The amount of time since the last invoice date is called the *Billing Period* and is on page one of the invoice. This time represents the date range during which charges accrue for the current invoice. If you made a change to your subscription outside of this date range, like adding or removing licenses or canceling a subscription, the associated charges appear on the invoice for the next billing period.

Starting on page two of the invoice, you see the charges grouped by their *Service Period*. The service period is the date range during which you're charged to use the service.

At the end of each billing period, you receive an email that says your new invoice is ready to view or download in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have more than one order, you receive an invoice for each order. Learn how to [find and view your bill or invoice](view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).

## Overview of the invoice .PDF

Your invoice is a .PDF that contains at least two pages. [Page one](#page-one) is the billing summary, and contains general information about the invoice, order, amount due, and payment instructions, if applicable.

## Why is my total due different from last month?

The amount billed for your subscription reflects the license price multiplied by the number of licenses purchased and any required taxes or fees.

If the amount billed is different than expected, there are a few reasons this can happen:

- You added or removed licenses from your subscription. Licenses changed mid-term are reflected on the next invoice. You might see a credit and re-bill for the previous service period to account for this change. For details about what this looks like in your invoice, see Page two below.
- The subscription was cancelled. You receive an invoice after cancellation with any outstanding balance minus any credits.
- Your subscription renewed for a new term and the license price changed.

## Invoice sections

This section explains the individual sections in your invoice.
### Header

The header appears at the top of every invoice page, and includes the month of service, and the Invoice Date, which is the date Microsoft created the invoice. The invoice is created the day after the end of your billing period. For example, if your billing period is Jan 15 - Feb 14, your invoice date is Feb 15.

The header also includes an *Invoice Number*, the unique number assigned to your invoice. If you pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or check, please reference the invoice number with your payment.

Finally, the header includes the *Due Date* for payment of the invoice, and shows the total amount due. If you pay for your subscription with a credit card or bank account, we charge your card or account the day after the invoice date.

### Footer

The footer appears at the bottom of every invoice page. It includes the phone number to call for billing or technical support, a link to online self-help articles, and the address and tax ID for Microsoft in your country or region.

### Page one

Page one of your invoice contains address information for your organization, high-level details about your order, a summary of invoice totals, and instructions about how to pay your invoice. If you have more than one product in your order, you see a separate section for each product and the associated charges.

#### Addresses

Three addresses appear at the top of the first page. Sold-To is the name and address of the organization that bought the subscription. Bill-To is the address of your billing department. Service Usage Address is the address where the service is used. Usually, these addresses are the same. Depending on the size and configuration of your organization, these addresses might be different.

To update the **Sold-To** address, see [Change your organization's address, technical contact, and more](../../admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more.md)**. To update your Bill-To** or **Service Usage Address**, see [Change your billing addresses](change-your-billing-addresses.md).

#### Order Details

On page one of your invoice, the *Product* is "Online Services.” This is the generic term we use to describe your subscription. Page two lists the individual products in your order.

*Customer PO Number* is the purchase order (PO) number that you specify. You can't add a PO number to an existing invoice. If you update the PO number, it’s included in future invoices. To change the PO number, see Change your purchase order number.

*Order Number* is the globally unique identifier (GUID) that identifies your order. Every time you buy a new subscription, a new order with a new order number is created. You receive an invoice for each order every billing period.

*Billing Period* is the period since the last invoice date.

*Payment Terms* is the number of days from the invoice date when payment is due. The standard payment term is 30 days.

*Due Date* is the date when the invoice payment is due. If your subscription is paid with a credit card or bank account, we charge your card or account the day after the Invoice Date.

#### Billing Summary

Page one of your invoice shows the totals of the following items for the invoice billing period. Page two contains details for each category.

- Charges
- Discounts
- Credits
- Tax
- Total

#### Payment Instructions

If you pay by credit card, you see "Please DO NOT PAY. You will be charged the amount due through your selected method of payment." If you pay by invoice, this section contains instructions for paying by EFT or check.

#### Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) and check

If you chose “invoice” as your subscription payment method, page one contains the Electronic Funds Transfer section that shows the Microsoft bank account information for electronic payments (wire, ACH, SEPA, etc.). Usually, your bank has a reference field you complete when you send a payment. Please reference the invoice number in that field.

If we accept payments by check for your country or region, you also see a **Check** section that contains the payee name and mailing address. Make sure you reference your invoice number on the check.

#### Support

The **Support** section includes instructions on how to view past invoices in the Microsoft 365 admin center. It also includes a link to self-help articles, and the support phone number for your country or region.

### Page two

The product name for your subscription is at the top of page two. Below it is the formula that explains how the charges are calculated.

#### New charges

:::image type="content" source="../../media/understand-your-invoice2/invoice-new-charges.png" alt-text="Alt text that describes the content of the image.":::

The **New charges** section shows the service period during which charges, discounts, credits, and taxes were added. It shows the number of licenses included during the service period, the price per license, and the number of days in the service period.

#### Previous charges

:::image type="content" source="../../media/understand-your-invoice2/invoice-previous-charges.png" alt-text="Alt text that describes the content of the image.":::

The **Previous charges** section shows a credit for charges you paid for the previous invoice. If you made a change during the previous billing period, your invoice includes the Previous charges section. For example, if you added or remove licenses mid-term, the Previous charges section shows the number of licenses for that service period, together with the monthly price per license, the number of days in the service period, the charges, and other amounts that apply.

#### Charges during this billing period

:::image type="content" source="../../media/understand-your-invoice2/invoice-charges-this-period.png" alt-text="Alt text that describes the content of the image.":::

The **Charges during this billing period** section shows changes to your subscription made during this billing period. If you made a change during the previous billing period, your invoice also includes the Changes during this billing period section. For example, if you added or removed licenses mid-term, the Charges during this billing period section lists the changes to the subscription and when they occurred. The charges or refunds owed to you because of those changes are prorated for the number of days affected during the billing period.
