# View your order history

After you've bought products or services for your organization, you can review order information on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109257" target="_blank">Order history</a> page.

By default, the **Order history** page lists orders in chronological order. You can reverse the chronological order and set a range of months for which to view orders. The order history list shows:

- **Order date** &mdash; the date the order was made
- **Order number** &mdash; a unique, alpha-numeric ID used to identify the order
- **Items** &mdash; the items contained in the order
- **Status** &mdash; the status of the order
- **Billing account** &mdash; the billing account used to make the order
- **Total** &mdash; the total cost of the order
- **Refund total** &mdash; the total of any refunds given with the order

Click to expand an order, and the following info is available:
- **Order date** &mdash; the date the order was made
- **Status** &mdash; the status of the order
- **Bill to** &mdash; the name and address of the billing profile used to make the order
