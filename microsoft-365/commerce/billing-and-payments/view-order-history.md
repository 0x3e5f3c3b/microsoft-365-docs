# View your order history

After you've bought products or services for your organization, you can review order information on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109257" target="_blank">Order history</a> page.

By default, the **Order history** page lists orders in chronological order. You can reverse the chronological order and set a range of months for which to view orders. The order history list shows:

- Order date – the date the order was made
- Order number – a unique, alpha-numeric ID used to identify the order
- Items – the items contained in the order
- Status – the status of the order
- Billing account – the billing account used to make the order
- Total – the total cost of the order
- Refund total – the total of any refunds given with the order

Click to expand an order, and the following info is available:
