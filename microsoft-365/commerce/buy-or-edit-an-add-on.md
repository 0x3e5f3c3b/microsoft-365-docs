# Buy or manage add-ons

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

> [!NOTE]
> The admin center is changing. If your experience doesn't match the details presented here, see 
[About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview?view=o365-21vianet&preserve-view=true).

::: moniker-end

Many Microsoft 365 for business plans have add-ons that you can buy for your subscriptions. Add-ons provide additional features to enhance your subscription experience.

There are two types of add-ons:

1. **Traditional add-ons** are linked to a specific subscription. If you cancel the subscription, the associated add-on is also canceled.
2. **Standalone add-on subscriptions** appear as a separate subscription on the **Your products** page and have their own expiration date. Unlike traditional add-ons, standalone add-on subscriptions aren’t linked to a specific subscription. You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the steps described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## Buy an add-on

Use the following steps to find and buy add-ons. The list only includes add-ons that are available to you. This list is based on your currently active subscriptions, and any other existing add-ons you already have. If an add-on isn’t on the list, it’s not available to buy.

For information about Skype for Business add-ons, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).

## Manage an add-on

You manage a standalone add-on subscription the same way that you manage any other subscription – on the **Your products** page. For example, you can [buy or remove licenses](licenses/buy-licenses.md), [manage recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md), and [edit or replace payment methods](billing-and-payments/manage-payment-methods.md) for standalone add-on subscriptions.

You manage a traditional add-on by going to the subscription that contains it and making changes there. Use the following steps to manage a traditional add-on.

## Remove an add-on

To remove a standalone add-on subscription, you [cancel the subscription](subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md), just like any other subscription. Or you can [turn off Recurring billing](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md).

You can’t remove a traditional add-on. If you want to remove a traditional add-on, [contact support for help](../admin/contact-support-for-business-products.md).
