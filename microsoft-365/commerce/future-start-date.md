# Understand invoicing for future start dates

Sales proposals might include subscriptions that start on a future date. A future start date aligns the start date of a new subscription with the end date of a previous subscription. If your proposal contains subscriptions that start on a future date, you receive an invoice for those subscriptions only when the future start date arrives. Using a future start date ensures that you arenâ€™t billed for items that you don't own yet. New subscriptions start on the date specified in the proposal. You will receive an email notifying that your new subscription is now active and your billing for this subscription will begin. Your next invoice reflects the new charges plus applicable taxes for the new subscription.
