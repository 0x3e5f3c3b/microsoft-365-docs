# Allotment basics

License allotments let you set license limits and delegate management of license assignment to only the products and license limits that you select. When you set a license limit with an allotment, you can assign licenses to groups and ensure that license assignment stops when you hit your license limit. This ensures that you don’t go over your license assignment quota.

Allotments use group-based licensing to assign licenses to your users. License limits provide added control over how many licenses can be assigned through group licensing. This lets you expand your current license assignment strategy to use license limits. You can also opt to delegate scoped access to a limited license pool (allotment) to another member of your organization.

## Prerequisites

You must meet the licensing requirements for [group-based licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-licensing-whatis-azure-portal#licensing-requirements).

You can use allotments with any Office 365 product available to users:

- Office suites and standalone products
- Enterprise and Mobility products
- Dynamics 365 products

The following products can’t be used with allotments:

- Microsoft Store apps
- Perpetual software, or software that is directly assigned to a user if there is no license involved.
- Azure resources

You must be a global or license admin to get started with an allotment.
