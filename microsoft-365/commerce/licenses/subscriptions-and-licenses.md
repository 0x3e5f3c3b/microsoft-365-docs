# Understand subscriptions and licenses in Microsoft 365 for business

When you buy a subscription to Microsoft 365 for business, you sign up for a set of applications and services that you pay for on either a monthly or an annual basis. The applications and services that you receive as part of your subscription depend on which product you purchased, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for business or Microsoft 365 Business Standard. You can review different licensing options available in [Microsoft 365 for small and medium-sized businesses](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/licensing-microsoft-365-in-smb).

When you buy a subscription, you specify the number of licenses that you need, based on how many people you have in your organization. After you buy a subscription, you create accounts for people, and then assign a license to each person. As your organizational needs change, you can buy more licenses to accommodate new people, or reassign licenses to other users when someone leaves your organization.

If you have more than one subscription, you can assign licenses to different people for each subscription. For example, you can have all of your users assigned to all Microsoft 365 applications and services as part of a Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription. Additionally, a subset of users can have a license for Visio Online through a separate Visio subscription.

## How many devices can people install Office on?

If your subscription includes any of the following products, each person can install Office on up to five PCs or Mac, five tablets, and five phones.
  
- Microsoft 365 Apps for business
- Microsoft 365 Business Standard
- Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise
- Office 365 Enterprise E3
- Office 365 Enterprise E5

## What happens when you assign a license to someone?

The following table lists what automatically happens when you assign a license to someone:
  
|**If the subscription has this service**|**This automatically happens**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Exchange Online  <br/> |A mailbox is created for that person. <br/> To learn about the SLA for this task to be completed, see ["Setting up..." messages in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2635238/setting-up-messages-in-the-office-365-admin-center). |
|SharePoint Online  <br/> |Edit permissions to the default SharePoint Online team site are assigned to that person.  <br/> |
|Skype for Business Online  <br/> |The person has access to the features associated with the license.  <br/> |
|Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise  <br/> |The person can download Office apps on up to five Macs or PCs, five tablets, and five smartphones.  <br/> |

## Understand licenses for non-user mailboxes

You don't need to assign licenses to resource mailboxes, room mailboxes, and shared mailboxes, except when they are over their storage quota of 50 gigabytes (GB). For more about non-user mailboxes, see the following articles:
  
- [Create a shared mailbox](../../admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox.md)
- [Shared Mailboxes in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/collaboration-exo/shared-mailboxes) for all other Microsoft 365 plans.
- [Create and Manage Room Mailboxes](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-room-mailboxes)
- [Manage Equipment Mailboxes](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-equipment-mailboxes)

## Who can assign licenses?

Different types of admins can work with licenses in different ways, depending on their roles. The following table lists the most common options. For a complete list of admin roles and privileges, see [About admin roles](../../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).
  
|**Admin role**|**Assign a license**|**Unassign a license**|**Buy more licenses**|**Delete an account**|
