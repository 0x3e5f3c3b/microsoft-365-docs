# Manage self-service purchase (Admins)

As an admin, you can see self-service purchases made by people in your organization. You can also see a list of users who have licenses for subscriptions bought through a self-service purchase.

Because self-service purchases are made by other people in your organization, you can’t see invoices, payment methods, or order history for those subscriptions. You can only see this information for subscriptions you buy.  You also can’t make changes to self-service purchases made by users in your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can’t prevent users in your organization from making self-service purchases or from buying more licenses for their subscriptions. If you want to prevent the purchase of certain products in your organization, we recommend that you use internal policies, procedures and communications to ensure that those individuals making self-service purchases are complying with company policies.

## View self-service subscriptions

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Products & services** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2109823" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page.  
2. Next to **Refine results**, from the **Account type** drop-down, choose **Self-service**.
3. To view more details about a subscription, choose one from the list.

## View who has licenses for a self-service purchase subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page.
2. Choose the filter icon, then choose Self-service.
3. Select a product to see licenses assigned to people.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If there are multiple purchases for a product, that product is only listed once, and the Available quantity column shows the total of all subscriptions bought for that product.
4. The Users list is grouped by the names of people who have made self-service purchases.
5. To export a list of users with licenses for these subscriptions, choose the subscriptions you want to export, then choose Export users.

## Centralize licenses under a single subscription

If you want to centralize licenses under one subscription, you can do that. For example, if someone made a self-service purchase and then left your company, you can centralize the people who have licenses for that subscription under a single subscription.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a> with your Global admin or Billing admin account.
2. Go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase services</a> page.
3. Find and choose the product you want to buy, then choose **Buy**.
4. Complete the remaining steps to complete your purchase.
5. Follow the steps in [View who has licenses for a self-service purchase subscription](#view-who-has-licenses-for-a-self-service-purchase-subscription) to export a list of users to reference in step 6.
6. Assign licenses to everyone who has a license in the other subscription. For full steps, see [Assign licenses to users](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users).
7. If possible, contact the person who bought the self-service purchase subscription and ask them to cancel it.
