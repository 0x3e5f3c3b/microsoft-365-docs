# Upgrade from Teams free to Microsoft 365 for business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This document only applies to Teams free organizations in India.

## Before you begin

You must be a Teams free admin to upgrade a Teams free organization. You're automatically an admin if you created the Teams free organization, or if another admin changed your role to admin.

## Step 1: Get your work or school account ID

You must first get your underlying work or school account ID before you continue the process. This is different from the email address that you use to access Teams.

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2134797" target="_blank">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com</a>
2. In the header, select the profile icon. Your account ID is displayed below your name, and ends with *.onmicrosoft.com*.\
    Your admin email address will look like *admin@yourfreeorgname.onmicrosoft.com*.

## Step 2: Reset your password

After you have the underlying work or school account for your Teams free org, you must reset the password for the account.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. When prompted to sign in, choose **Forgot my password**.
2. Complete the password reset procedure using the underlying work or school account (the one ending with 8.onmicrosoft.com*).
3. Complete the verification steps. You receive an email with a code to use to set a new password.
4. Enter the code to complete the verification process.

## Step 3: Buy your new subscription

Use the underlying work or school account that you recovered and your new admin password to buy a new Microsoft 365 subscription.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433" target="_blank">Purchase Services</a>.
2. Find the Microsoft 365 product that you want to buy.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to choose one that includes Teams.
3. Complete the purchase. Remember to buy enough licenses for all the users in your Teams free org who you want to move to Microsoft 365.

## Step 4: Assign new licenses to users

Now that you have a new Microsoft 365 subscription, you can assign licenses to the existing users in your Teams free organization.

1. In the admin center, go to **Users** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a>.
2. Select the users to whom you want to assign Microsoft 365 licenses, then select **Manage product licenses**.
3. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, select **Replace existing license assignments**.
4. In the **Replace existing products** pane, find the Microsoft 365 product that you bought, and switch the toggle to **On**.
5. Select **Replace**, then select **Close**.
