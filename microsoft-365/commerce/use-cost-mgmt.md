# Use Cost management in the Microsoft 365 admin center

If you’re a Global or Billing admin with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), you can use the **Cost management** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center to view, analyze, and manage your cloud costs. To get to the **Cost management** page, in the admin center left navigation pane, select **Billing** > **Cost management**.

## Before you begin

You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the steps described in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## What is cost management?

In general, cost management is a methodology used to plan and control an organization’s budget. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, the cost management features help reduce the cost and overhead needed to manage your organization’s assets. As part of this feature, Microsoft is introducing new products and services that use a pay-as-you-go billing model, where you only pay for what you use. You can use these new cost management features to:

- Do billing administrative tasks like paying your bill
- Manage billing access to costs
- Download cost and usage data used to generate your monthly invoice
- Proactively apply data analysis to your costs
- Set spending thresholds
- Identify opportunities for workload changes that can optimize your spending (internal processes)

To learn more about how to approach cost management as an organization, see [Cost Management best practices](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-best-practices).

## Understand Microsoft 365 billing

Microsoft 365 billing features are used to review your invoiced costs and manage access to billing information. In larger organizations, procurement and finance teams usually conduct billing tasks.
A billing account is created when you sign up to use Microsoft 365. You use your billing account to manage your invoices and payments, and track costs. It’s possible to have multiple billing accounts. For each legal entity or sold-to address for your organization, you receive a separate billing account.

## Plan and control costs

Cost management in the admin center helps you plan for and control your organization’s costs by helping you do the following tasks:

- **Do cost analysis:** You use cost analysis to explore and analyze your organizational costs. You can view aggregated costs by organization to understand where costs are accrued and to identify spending trends. You can also see accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.
- **Create budgets:** Budgets help you plan for and meet financial accountability in your organization. They help prevent cost thresholds or limits from being surpassed. Budgets can also help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs. And with budgets, you can see how spending in your organization progresses over time.
- **View recommendations:** Recommendations show how you can optimize and improve efficiency by identifying idle and underutilized resources. They can also show less expensive resource options. When you act on the recommendations, you change the way you use your resources to save money. To act, you first view cost optimization recommendations to view potential usage inefficiencies. 
- **Export cost management data:** You can export your cost management data to do your own analysis, or to combine with data from other sources.

## View costs

The **Cost management** page in the admin center has a **Services** tab that lets you see the breakdown of the different products and services you’re using today.

Use the **Services** tab to see the list of all services being used during the selected period. The chart on the page breaks down the costs daily for the top 10 services. Use the date picker to look back at historical costs and use different date ranges to compare cost trends.

## Download costs

Select **Download** to download the cost analysts data into a CSV or Excel file. You can use the data to further analyze your charges or merge with other data, as needed.

## Create budgets

Budgets let you monitor your charges and ensure you’re aware when you go over specified thresholds. You can choose between creating a quick budget where you set a threshold amount that you want to stay under each month. This will send you, i.e., the user logged in, a notification when your costs exceed this threshold.

Select **Configure advanced settings** to create a budget name and to change the budget frequency. You set up a monthly, quarterly, or annual budget, and choose the period for which budget notifications are sent.

## Next steps

Now that you're familiar with Cost management, the next step is to start using the service.
