# Apply published retention labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

After you've [configured and published retention labels](create-retention-labels.md), you can apply them in different ways.

If you need information about what retention labels and how they work, see [Learn about retention labels](labels.md).

## Manually apply retention labels 

This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy.

End users, as well as administrators, can manually apply retention labels from the following locations:  

- Outlook and Outlook on the web
    
- OneDrive
    
- SharePoint
    
- Microsoft 365 groups (both the group site and group mailbox in Outlook on the web)
    
Use the following sections to understand how to apply retention labels. 

### Applying retention labels in Outlook

To label an item in the Outlook desktop client, select the item. On the **Home** tab on the ribbon, click **Assign Policy**, and then choose the retention label. 
  
![Assign Policy button](../media/30684dea-dd73-4e4a-9185-8e29f403b6ca.png)
  
You can also right-click an item, click **Assign Policy** in the context menu, and then choose the retention label. 

After the retention label is applied, you can view that retention label and what action it takes at the top of the item. If an email has a retention label applied that has an associated retention period, you can see at a glance when the email expires.
  
You can also apply retention labels to folders, in which case:
  
- All items in the folder automatically get the same retention label, **except** for items that have had a retention label applied explicitly to them. Explicitly labeled items keep their existing retention label. For more information, see [The principles of retention, or what takes precedence?](#the-principles-of-retention-or-what-takes-precedence) section on this page. 
    
- If you change or remove the default retention label for a folder, the retention label's also changed or removed for all items in the folder, **except** items with explicitly assigned retention labels. 
    
- If you move an item with a default retention label from one folder to another folder with a different default retention label, the item gets the new default retention label.
    
- If you move an item with a default retention label from one folder to another folder with no default retention label, the old default retention label is removed.

### Applying retention labels in Outlook on the web

To label an item in Outlook on the web, right-click the item \> **Assign policy** \> choose the retention label. 
  
![Assign policy menu in Outlook on the web](../media/146a23cf-e478-4595-b2e8-f707fc4e6ea3.png)
  
After the retention label is applied, you can view that retention label and what action it takes at the top of the item. If an email is classified and has an associated retention period, you can know at a glance when the email will expire.
  
![Label assigned to email in Outlook on the web](../media/16f6c91b-5eab-4574-9d13-6d12be00a783.png)
  
As with Outlook on the web, you can also apply retention labels to folders. 

### Applying retention labels in OneDrive and SharePoint

To label a document (including OneNote files) in OneDrive or SharePoint, select the item \> in the upper-right corner, choose **Open the details pane**![Information pane icon](../media/50b6d51b-92b4-4c5f-bb4b-4ca2d4aa3d04.png) \> **Apply retention label** \> choose the retention label. 
  
You can also apply a retention label to a folder or document set, and you can set a [default retention label for a document library](#applying-a-default-retention-label-to-all-content-in-a-sharepoint-library-folder-or-document-set).
  
![Apply label list for an item in SharePoint](../media/151cc83c-da57-45b0-9cd1-fd2f28a31083.png)
  
After a retention label is applied to an item, you can view it in the details pane when that item's selected.
  
![Applied label shown in Details pane](../media/d06e585e-29f7-4c8c-afef-629c97268b8e.png)
  
For SharePoint, but not OneDrive, you can create a view of the library that contains the **Labels** column or **Item is a Record** column. This view lets you see at a glance the retention labels assigned to all items and which items are records. Note, however, that you can't filter the view by the **Item is a Record** column. For instructions how to add columns, see [Show or hide columns in a list or library](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-or-hide-columns-in-a-list-or-library-b820db0d-9e3e-4ff9-8b8b-0b2dbefa87e2).


### Applying retention labels in Microsoft 365 groups

When you publish retention labels to Microsoft 365 groups ([formerly Office 365 groups](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/office-365-groups-will-become-microsoft-365-groups/ba-p/1303601)), the retention labels appear in both the group site and group mailbox in Outlook on the web. The experience of applying a retention label to content is identical to that for email and documents.

To retain content for a Microsoft 365 group, use the **Office 365 groups** location. Even though a Microsoft 365 group has an Exchange mailbox, a retention policy that includes the entire Exchange location won't include content in Microsoft 365 group mailboxes.

In addition, it's not possible to use the Exchange location to include or exclude a specific group mailbox. Although the Exchange location initially allows a group mailbox to be selected, when you try to save the retention policy, you receive an error that "RemoteGroupMailbox" is not a valid selection for the Exchange location.
  
First, create and configure the sensitivity labels that you want to make available for apps and other services. For example, the labels you want users to see and apply from Office apps. 

Then, create one or more label policies that contain the labels and policy settings that you configure. It's the label policy that publishes the labels and settings for your chosen users and locations.

## Automatically applying a retention label based on conditions

This method requires retention labels to be auto-published.

One of the most powerful features of retention labels is the ability to apply them automatically to content that matches certain conditions. In this case, people in your organization don't need to apply the retention labels. Microsoft 365 does the work for them.
  
![Diagram of roles and tasks for auto-apply labels](../media/32f2f2fd-18a8-43fd-839d-72ad7a43e069.png)
  
Auto-applying retention labels are powerful because:
  
- You don't need to train your users on all of your classifications.
    
- You don't need to rely on users to classify all content correctly.
    
- Users no longer need to know about data governance policies - they can focus on their work.
    
You can choose to apply retention labels to content automatically when that content contains:
  
- [Specific types of sensitive information](create-retention-labels.md#auto-apply-labels-to-content-with-specific-types-of-sensitive-information)
    
- [Specific keywords that match a query you create](create-retention-labels.md#auto-apply-labels-to-content-with-keywords-or-searchable-properties)

- [A match for trainable classifiers](create-retention-labels.md#auto-apply-labels-to-content-by-using-trainable-classifiers)

> [!TIP]
> See [Manage the lifecycle of SharePoint documents with retention labels](auto-apply-retention-labels-scenario.md) for a detailed scenario about using managed properties in SharePoint to auto-apply retention labels and implement event-driven retention.

## Applying a default retention label to all content in a SharePoint library, folder, or document set

This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy.

In addition to enabling people to apply a retention label to individual documents, you can also apply a default retention label to a SharePoint library, folder, or document set, so that all documents in that location get the default retention label.
  
For a document library, this is done on the **Library settings** page for a document library. When you choose the default retention label, you can also choose to apply it to existing items in the library. 
  
For example, if you have a tag for marketing materials, and you know a specific document library contains only that type of content, you can make the Marketing Materials tag the default for all documents in that library.
  
![Apply label option on library Settings page](../media/0787d651-63dc-43b4-8768-716a5ecc64ec.png)
  
If you apply a default retention label to existing items in the library, folder, or document set:
  
- All items in the library, folder, or document set automatically get the same retention label, **except** for items that have had a retention label applied explicitly to them (such as records). Explicitly labeled items keep their existing label. For more information, see the below section on [The principles of retention, or what takes precedence](#the-principles-of-retention-or-what-takes-precedence).
    
- If you change or remove the default retention label for a library, folder, or document set, the retention label is also changed or removed for all items in the library, folder, or document set, **except** items with explicit retention labels (such as records).
    
- If you move an item with a default retention label from one site collection, library, folder, or document set to another site collection, library, folder, or document set that has a different label, the item keeps its existing default retention label, even if the new location has a different default retention label. If the item does not have a label before moving, it will take on the default retention label of the new location.

**Records:** If you apply a default record label to a library, folder, or document set, then a record label is applied to all the individual items within those locations. When you move a new item into a location with a record label, that item is labeled a record. However, if you change the default retention label to a label that doesn't declare content as a record, that action does not remove the record label from the individual items; those items retain their record label. Only a site collection admin can explicitly remove or change the retention label of record items.

For more information about retention labels that declare content as a record, see [Learn about records](records.md).

## Automatically applying a retention label to email by using rules

This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy.

In Outlook, you can create rules to apply a retention label or retention policy.
  
For example, you can create a rule that applies a specific retention label to all messages sent to or from a specific distribution group.
  
To create a rule, right-click an item \> **Rules** \> **Create Rule** \> **Advanced Options** \> **Rules Wizard** \> **apply retention policy**.
  
![Rules wizard with option to apply retention policies](../media/eeb2407c-15b6-4224-99cf-e0a00034d8ea.png)
  
## Classifying content without applying any actions

This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy.

When you create a retention label, you can do so without turning on any retention or other actions. In this case, you can use a retention label simply as a text label, without enforcing any actions.
  
For example, you can create a retention label named "Review later" with no actions, and then auto-apply that retention label to content with sensitive information types or queried content.

## Using a retention label as a condition in a DLP policy

This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy or an auto-apply policy.

A retention label can enforce retention actions on content. In addition, you can use a retention label as a condition in a data loss prevention (DLP) policy, and the DLP policy can enforce other actions, such as restricting access, on content that contains a specific label. 
  
For more information, see [Using a retention label as a condition in a DLP policy](data-loss-prevention-policies.md#using-a-retention-label-as-a-condition-in-a-dlp-policy).

## Using retention labels to mark content as a record
    
This method requires retention labels to be published to a retention label policy.

You can use retention labels to mark items as a record. This lets you implement a single, consistent records-management strategy across Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Learn about records](records.md).

## Next steps

Event-based retention is another supported scenario for retention labels. For more information, see the following articles:
