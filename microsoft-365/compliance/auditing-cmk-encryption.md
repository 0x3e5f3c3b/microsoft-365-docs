# Use Customer Key to encrypt audit records

Your Microsoft 365 organization can use [Customer Key](customer-key-overview.md) to encrypt the audit records generated by user and admin activity. Auditing data is always encrypted at rest in the Microsoft 365 service with BitLocker and Distributed Key Manager. Implementing Customer Key provides extra protection by preventing unauthorized systems or Microsoft data center personnel from viewing your auditing data in the auditing pipeline and at rest. Using Customer Key to encrypt your auditing data also helps you meet regulatory or compliance obligations because your organization provides and controls the encryption keys. Microsoft 365 uses these keys to encrypt your organization's auditing data so that only users in your organization can view your audit records because only your organization has the encryption keys.

> [!NOTE]
> Customer Key requires a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 guidance for security & compliance](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection-customer-key-for-microsoft-365).

## Implement Customer Key for auditing

To implement Customer Key for auditing, you have to create a multi-workload Data Encryption Policy (DEP), which defines the encryption hierarchy. This hierarchy is used by the service to encrypt your auditing data using the two root keys you manage and the availability key that's autogenerated and protected by Microsoft.

Here's a high-level overview of implementing a multi-workload DEP to enable Customer Key for auditing. Use this high-level guidance as a road map and then follow the [step-by-step instructions](customer-key-set-up.md) to implement Customer Key for auditing.

Create two Azure subscriptions. Customer Key requires two Azure subscriptions.

1. Create an Azure Key Vault in each subscription.

2. Create your Customer Keys in the key vaults that you created in the previous step.

3. Grant access to the key vaults to the M365DataAtRestEncryption Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) app. The AppID for this app is **c066d759-24ae-40e7-a56f-027002b5d3e4**.

4. Configure the following two settings for the Azure Key Vault that you created in step 1. These settings help prevent the inadvertent deletion of your keys and facilitates the key recovery process.

   - Enable Soft Delete.

   - Mark the recovery level for the Azure Key Value subscription as *Do Not Cancel*.

5. Contact the Microsoft Data Encryption Policy Service (MDEPS) team to onboard MDEPS for your organization.

6. Use the [New-M365DataAtRestEncryptionPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-m365dataatrestencryptionpolicy) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to create a multi-workload DEP.

7. Use the [Set-M365DataAtRestEncryptionPolicyAssignment](/powershell/module/exchange/set-m365dataatrestencryptionpolicyassignment) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to assign the multi-workload DEP that you created in the previous step to your organization. After you assign the multi-workload DEP, you can't disable it.

After you complete these steps, Microsoft 365 encrypts all data in your organization, including audit records, using the keys that are identified in the multi-workload DEP that you created in step 6.
