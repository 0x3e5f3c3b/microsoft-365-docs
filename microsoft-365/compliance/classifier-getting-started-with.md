description: "A Microsoft 365 classifier is an easy to use machine learning tool you can train to recognize various types of content by giving it samples to look at. Once the classifier is trained and you confirm it's results are accurate, you use it to search through your organizations content, classify it and apply retention or sensitivity labels."
