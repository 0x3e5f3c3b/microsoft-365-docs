# Learn about collections in Advanced eDiscovery

When organizations are faced with gathering the communications and content that may be relevant to an investigation or potential litigation, they undertake a significant challenge under the best of circumstances. In todayâ€™s modern workplace, the volume, variety and velocity of content is enabling innovation and remote work, while also expanding the requirements and process for managing collections for investigations.

Not only does this workflow pose significant technical challenges around extracting content from native locations and sources, but it is also a critical point in the assessment and strategy for common litigation or investigations scenarios. As organizations start to assess an investigation, the first questions asked are who was involved? And custodians may quickly be placed on hold to preserve relevant content, and then What took place? To answer this second fundamental question of any investigation, managers must turn to the data. To quickly assess the most relevant content to the question of what took place, managers start to refine the target of the question to ensure that the collection results are comprehensive without being too broad.

Collections in Advanced eDiscovery helps an eDiscovery manager quickly scope a search for content across email, documents and other content in Microsoft 365 and get estimates to quickly inform a decision on the size and scope of content that may be relevant to a case. eDiscovery managers will now create a collection, instead of a search, to identify custodians, data sources e.g. exchange mailboxes, or SharePoint sites and specific conditions including keywords, date ranges and more to quickly define the scope of their collection.

Once the collection is defined, eDiscovery managers can save the Collection as a draft and get preview estimates, including estimates for data volume, source locations and hits by query condition. These insights will help to inform if the Collection should be revised further prior to proceeding to minimization and review.

When the manager is satisfied with the scope of the collection, and the estimated amount of content that is likely to be responsive they are ready to commit the content to collection into a review set; including defining options for the collection around conversations, versions and cloud attachments. The content in the collection will now go thru another level of processing during ingestion to the review set, and the collection will be updated with the final collection summary. Once in the review set, eDiscovery managers can continue to query, group and refine the content to aide in minimization and review.

Within the Advanced eDiscovery case portal, search is now named collections. The steps to define the scope and size of the collection follow the same process as search to define locations and conditions. Save as draft and get preview estimates enables quick validation of targeted scope of collections prior to committing a full search and collection into the review set. This enables improved job management, and targeted iterations for starting to minimize content during the search and collection process.

## Collections workflow

To get you started using collections in Advanced eDiscovery, here's a basic workflow and descriptions of each step in the process.

1. Create draft collection

2. Get estimates and view statistics

3. Edit draft collection and rerun

4. Commit a draft collection to a review set

5. Review collection summary and statistics
