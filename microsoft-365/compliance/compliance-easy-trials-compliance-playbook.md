## Advanced Audit

**Conduct investigations**

Advanced Audit helps organizations to conduct forensic and compliance investigations by increasing audit log retention required to conduct an investigation, providing access to crucial events that help determine scope of compromise, and providing faster access to the Office 365 Management Activity API.

## Communication Compliance

**Identify and act on code of conduct policy violations**

Communication compliance helps you intelligently identify communication violations to support a compliant and healthy work environment by helping you detect inappropriate messages, investigate possible policy violations, and take steps to remediate.

## Compliance Manager

**Manage your organizational compliance easily**

Compliance Manager can help you throughout your compliance journey, from taking inventory of your data protection risks to managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications, and reporting to auditors.

## Data Loss Prevention

**Protect sensitive data**

To comply with business standards and industry regulations, organizations need to protect sensitive info to prevent its inadvertent disclosure. Set up data loss prevention policies to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive info across Microsoft 365.

## eDiscovery

**Discover more with an end-to-end workflow**

Take advantage of an end-to-end workflow for preserving, collecting, analyzing, and exporting content that’s responsive to your organization’s internal and external investigations. Legal teams can also manage the entire legal hold notification process by communicating with custodians involved in a case.

## Information Protection

**Discover, classify and protect your sensitive information**

Implement Microsoft Information Protection and sensitivity labels, to help you discover, classify, and protect your sensitive content wherever it lives or travels.

## Insider Risk Management

**Detect and remediate insider risks**

Leverage artificial intelligence to help you quickly identify, triage, and remediate internal risks. Using logs from Microsoft 365 and Azure services, you can define policies that monitor for insider risk signals, then take remediation actions such as promoting user education or initiating an investigation.

## Records Management

**Automate the retention schedule for business-critical records​**

Use integrated Records Management features to automate the retention schedule for organizational regulatory, legal, and business-critical records. Get full content lifecycle support, from creation to collaboration, record declaration, retention, and disposition.

## Compliance Manager Premium Assessment

**Assess risks and efficiently respond**

Help your organization assess risks and efficiently respond to nations, regional and industry requirements governing the collection and use of data.

## Privacy Management

**Identify & prevent​ privacy risks**

Proactively identify and protect against privacy risks such as data hoarding, data transfers, and data oversharing and help your organization automate and manage subject requests at scale.​
