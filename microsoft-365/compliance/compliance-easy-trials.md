# About the free trial for Microsoft Compliance

Microsoft compliance products protect your organization from internal threats rising from inappropriate permissions on files and emails, and ensures compliance with regulatory and policy requirements.

A Microsoft E5 compliance trial is the easiest way to try the capabilities of Microsoft compliance products, and setting it up only takes a couple of clicks. After the trial setup is complete, all features of the Microsoft E5 license package are available for you to use for up to 90 days.

## Terms and conditions

See the [terms and conditions](terms-conditions.md) for the Microsoft 365 free trial.

## Set up a Compliance trial

You can sign-up for a trial in the Microsoft compliance center using the Trials link in the left navigation pane.

## Licensing

As part of the trial setup, the Microsoft E5 compliance licenses are automatically applied to the organization. The licenses are active for the first 90 days.

## Permissions

To start or end the trial, you need to be a member of the Global Administrator or Security Administrator roles in Azure Active Directory. For details, see About admin roles.

## Additional information

After you enroll in the trial, it might take up to 2 hours for the changes and updates to be available. And, admins must log out and log back in to see the changes.

You can extend the trial within the last 15 days of the trial period. You are limited to a maximum of two trial periods. If you do not extend by the time your trial period ends, you must wait at least 30 days before signing up for a second trial.

## Ending the trial

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the compliance card.

If you decide not to enroll in a feature that is part of the compliance trial, your trial data will be maintained for a period of time, usually 180 days, before being permanently deleted. You may continue to access the data gathered during the trial until that time.

## Availability

The Microsoft Compliance free trial is gradually rolling out to existing customers who meet specific criteria (including geography) who don't already have a Microsoft E5 license package.
