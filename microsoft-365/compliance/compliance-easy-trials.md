# About the Microsoft Purview solutions trial

Microsoft Purview solutions help protect your organization from internal threats rising from inappropriate permissions on files and emails, and helps your organization to comply with regulatory and policy requirements.

The Microsoft Purview solutions trial is the easiest way to try all the capabilities of Microsoft Purview solutions, and setting it up only takes a couple of minutes. After the trial setup is complete, all features of the Microsoft E5 license package are available for you to use for up to 90 days.

## Terms and conditions

See the [terms and conditions](terms-conditions.md) for Microsoft Purview trials.

## Eligibility

Microsoft 365 E3 and Office 365 E3 customers who don't already have a Microsoft E5 license package are eligible for the Purview solutions trial. The trial isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government customers.

## Required roles for starting the trial

Users must hold one of the following admin roles in order to sign up for or end a trial:
- Billing Administrator
- Compliance Administrator
- Global Administrator

Get details on roles at [About admin roles](../admin/add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

## How to sign up for the trial

You can sign up for a trial following these steps:

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077149), select **Trials** on the left navigation to get to the Microsoft 365 trials hub.
2. Under **Compliance trials**, find the **Microsoft Purview solutions** card and select **Try now**.
3. On the **Microsoft Purview solutions trial** flyout pane, review the information about what's included and what to expect when you start the trial, then select **Start trial.**

Your trial will be effective immediately for 90 days. It can take up to two hours for all Purview solutions to appear in your left navigation. Sign out and sign back in to see the updates.

## Licensing, getting started, and ending the trial

#### Licensing

As part of the trial setup, 300 Microsoft E5 compliance licenses are automatically applied to your organization. The licenses are active for 90 days.

#### Getting started

You can start using Purview solutions as soon as you see them in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Nothing is created automatically and users won't be affected. When you navigate to each solution, you may be guided to make additional setup configurations to start using features.

Use our [trial playbook](compliance-easy-trials-compliance-playbook.md) to help you get started.

#### Extending the trial

You can extend the trial within the last 15 days of the trial period. You're limited to a maximum of two trial periods. If you don't extend by the time your trial period ends, you'll need to wait at least 30 days before signing up for a second trial.

#### Ending the trial

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the **Purview solutions trial** card compliance in the Microsoft 365 trials hub (see [How to set up the trial](#how-to-set-up-the-trial)) and selecting **End trial**.

If you decide not to enroll in a feature that's part of the Purview solutions trial, unless stated otherwise for the solution, your trial data will be maintained for a period of time, usually 180 days, before being permanently deleted. You may continue to access the data gathered during the trial until that time.

Wondering what you can experience in your free trial? The Purview solutions trial includes the following solutions:

- **Audit**

  Advanced Audit helps organizations to conduct forensic and compliance investigations by increasing audit log retention required to conduct an investigation, providing access to crucial events that help determine scope of compromise, and faster access to Office 365 Management Activity API. [Learn more about Audit](advanced-audit.md)

- **Communication Compliance**

  Communication Compliance helps you overcome modern compliance challenges associated with internal and external communications by helping you automatically capture inappropriate messages, investigate possible policy violations, and take steps to remediate. Learn more about [Communication Compliance](communication-compliance.md)

- **Compliance Manager**

  Compliance Manager can help you throughout your compliance journey, from taking inventory of your data protection risks to managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications, and reporting to auditors. [Learn more about Compliance Manager](compliance-manager.md)

- **eDiscovery**

  Take advantage of an end-to-end workflow for preserving, collecting, analyzing, and exporting content that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations. Legal teams can also manage the entire legal hold notification process by communicating with custodians involved in a case. [Learn more about eDiscovery](ediscovery.md)

- **Information Governance**

  Automate your retention policy coverage using Adaptive Policy Scopes. This feature allows you to dynamically target retention policies to specific users, groups, or sites. These policies automatically update when changes occur in your organization. In addition, retention policies using adaptive scopes are not subject to location limits. [Learn more about Adaptive Policy Scopes](create-retention-policies.md).

- **Information Protection**

  Implement Microsoft Information Protection with [sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md) and [data loss prevention policies](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md) to help you discover, classify, and protect your sensitive content wherever it lives or travels.

  The Information Protection trial provides you with default labels, auto-labeling for documents and emails, and data loss prevention to protect credit card numbers shared in Teams and by devices. The default policies we create for you get you up and running quickly, but you can fully customize them as you want.

    When the trial ends, you'll receive an email that informs you:

  - All files and emails labeled during your trial stay labeled. You can manually remove the labels.
  - You'll be downgraded to your previous Microsoft E3 license package that doesn't support auto-labeling and data loss prevention. Your existing policies will stay turned on unless you turn them off.
  - Any auto-labeling policies cannot be edited after the trial ends, but can be deleted.
  - If you edit DLP policies that include either the Teams or Devices locations after the trial ends, those locations will be removed from the policy.

  For more information about each of these preconfigured features and how they will impact users, see [Learn about the free trial for Microsoft Information Protection](mip-easy-trials.md).

- **Insider Risk Management**

  Leverage artificial intelligence to help you quickly identify, triage, and remediate internal risks. Using logs from Microsoft 365 and Azure services, you can define policies that monitor for risk signals, then take remediation actions such as promoting user education or initiating an investigation.
