# Salesforce setup for Compliance Manager connector

Follow the instructions on this page to enable the connection between your Salesforce account and the Compliance Manager connector for Salesforce.

## Overview

The Salesforce connector for Compliance Manager uses the SOAP API and UsernameToken authentication, passing username, password, and security token to login method (provided by proxy class). The SOAP endpoints utilize basic authentication. Requests are made using the proxy classes generated by the Salesforce Sales Cloud tenant Enterprise WSDL and will take the username and password as arguments for the login method.

Login requests are handled through the standard frontdoor.jsp page in Salesforce Sales Cloud. Following a successful login, a sessionId is returned. The returned sessionId functions as proof of authentication and must be provided as a header for all authenticated requests. Unsecure connections are blocked, so requests must be made through HTTPS or TLS 1.2+.
