# Customize Compliance Score with assessments

**In this article:** Learn how to customize Compliance Score by setting up your assessments. This article discusses the **pre-configured assessments** provided by Microsoft, explains how to modify assessments to suit your needs, and how to create your own assessments. This article also covers how to organize assessments into **groups**, working with **controls**, and creating **reports**.

## Introduction to assessments

Compliance Score becomes more useful as you create assessments for the regulations and certifications that apply to your organization. Assessments are groupings of controls that help you evaluate whether you’ve met a compliance objective. The way to ensure you’re implementing policies and operational procedures to limit your compliance risk is to set up the most relevant assessments for you. 

## Data protection baseline default assessment

To get you started, Microsoft provides a Default assessment in Compliance Score for you that contains the Microsoft 365 data protection baseline. This baseline is a set of controls that includes key regulations and standards for data protection and general data governance. This baseline draws elements primarily from NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization), as well as from FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union).

This assessment is used to calculate your initial score the first time you come to Compliance Score, and before you configure any other assessments. Upon your first visit, Compliance Score is already collecting signals from your Microsoft 365 solutions. Even if your organization did not set up any additional assessments, you would receive valuable and actionable insights on your organization’s current compliance posture related to some of the most significant data protection standards and regulations.

Because every organization has specific needs and accountabilities, Compliance Score relies on your actions to set up and monitor your own assessments in order to help you minimize and mitigate risk as comprehensively as possible.

## Create assessments: overview

There are three ways you can set up assessments:
1. Use a pre-configured assessment created by Microsoft.
2. Modify a pre-configured assessment to suit your own needs.
3. Create your own Custom Assessment.

### Use a pre-configured assessment

Compliance Score has multiple built-in assessments to cover a variety of regulations and certifications that align to industries, regions, and common data protection standards, such as GDPR and ISO 27001. These assessments are based off of templates that include the necessary controls and improvement actions to fulfill the assessment’s objective.

View the full list of templates for assessments provided by Microsoft.  

To start using a built-in assessment for your organization, you’ll choose from among our pre-configured templates when you start [building the assessment from the wizard](#create-an-assessment).

### Modify a pre-configured assessment

You have the ability to modify the template of a built-in assessment in order to better suit your organization’s needs. For example, if you generally need to comply with HIPPA but require additional data protection or security measures, you can take our HIPPA template and add your own custom fields to create a new assessment that monitors your progress in the ways you require.

To set up this type of modified, customized assessment for your organization, you’ll first need to create a custom template. During public preview, you’ll need to visit Compliance Manager to create and manage your custom templates. Follow these instructions:

1. Decide which built-in assessment you want to modify by viewing the list of templates.
2. Visit the [Compliance Manager instructions to customize a template using the extension process](working-with-compliance-manager.md#customize-a-template-through-the-extension-process).
3. Once you’ve created your template and imported it into Compliance Manger, you can then create your new assessment in Compliance Score. Follow the process of building your assessment using the assessment creation wizard.
