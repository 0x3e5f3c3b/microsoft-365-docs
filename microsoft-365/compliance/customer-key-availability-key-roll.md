(TB):The first sentence here should be removed since it conflicts with the Caution below it, "Only roll an encryption key that you use with Customer Key when a clear technical reason exists or a compliance requirement dictates that you have to roll the key." The word "never" is wrong, since, given enough time, a hacker will be able to crack any code. Brijesh got mad at me when I said "customers don't need to rotate keys" during a customer meeting, despite my alignment with the documentation.

# Roll or rotate a Customer Key or an availability key

 Customers can configure their Customer Keys to be stored in a hardware security module (HSM). Keys that you protect with a HSM are virtually impossible to compromise. Even if a root key were in the possession of a malicious actor, there is no feasible means to use it to decrypt data. Only Office 365 code knows how to use these keys.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Only roll an encryption key that you use with Customer Key when a clear technical reason exists or a compliance requirement dictates that you must roll the key. In addition, do not delete any keys that are or were associated with policies. When you roll your keys, there will be content encrypted with the previous keys. For example, while active mailboxes will be re-encrypted frequently, inactive, disconnected, and disabled mailboxes may still be encrypted with the previous keys. SharePoint Online performs backup of content for restore and recovery purposes, so there may still be archived content using older keys.

## Request a new version of each existing key you want to roll

<!---
(TB): "You use the same cmdlet" as...? When you created the key? 
-->

When you roll a key, you request a new version of an existing key. To request a new version of an existing key, you use the same cmdlet, [Add-AzureKeyVaultKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/AzureRM.KeyVault/Add-AzureKeyVaultKey), with the same syntax that you used to create the key in the first place. After youâ€™ve finished rolling any key associated with a Data Encryption Policy (DEP), you run another cmdlet to ensure that Customer Key begins using the new key. Do this step in each Azure Key Vault (AKV).

For example:

1. Log in to your Azure subscription with Azure PowerShell. For instructions, see [Log in with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps?view=azurermps-4.3.1).

2. Run the Add-AzureKeyVaultKey cmdlet as shown in the following example:

   ```powershell
   Add-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1 -Name Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1-Key001 -Destination HSM -KeyOps @('wrapKey','unwrapKey') -NotBefore (Get-Date -Date "12/27/2016 12:01 AM")
   ```

   In this example, since a key named **Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1-Key001** exists in the **Contoso-O365EX-NA-VaultA1** vault, the cmdlet creates a new version of the key. This operation preserves the previous key versions in the version history for the key. You need the previous key version to decrypt the data that it still encrypts. Once you complete rolling any key associated with a DEP,  run an extra cmdlet to ensure that Customer Key begins using the new key. The following sections describe the cmdlets in more detail.
  
## Update the Customer Key for Exchange Online and Skype for Business

When you roll either of the Azure Key Vault keys associated with a DEP used with Exchange Online and Skype for Business, you must update the DEP to point to the new key. This does not rotate the availability key.

To instruct Customer Key to use the new key to encrypt mailboxes in Office 365 run the Set-DataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet as follows:

1. Run the Set-DataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet in Azure PowerShell:
  
   ```powershell
   Set-DataEncryptionPolicy <policyname> -Refresh
   ```

   Within 72 hours, the active mailboxes associated with this DEP become encrypted with the new key.

2. To check the value for the DataEncryptionPolicyID property for the mailbox, use the steps in [Determine the DEP assigned to a mailbox](customer-key-manage.md#DeterminemailboxDEP). The value for this property changes once the service applies the updated key.
  
## Update the Customer Key for SharePoint Online, including Team Sites, and OneDrive for Business

SharePoint Online only allows you to roll one key at a time. If you want to roll both keys in a key vault, wait for the first operation to complete. Microsoft recommends that you stagger your operations to avoid this issue. When you roll either of the Azure Key Vault keys associated with a DEP used with SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, you must update the DEP to point to the new key. This does not rotate the availability key.

1. Run the [Update-SPODataEncryptionPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt843948.aspx) cmdlet as follows:
  
   ```powershell
   Update-SPODataEncryptionPolicy -Identity <SPOAdminSiteUrl> -KeyVaultName <ReplacementKeyVaultName> -KeyName <ReplacementKeyName> -KeyVersion <ReplacementKeyVersion> -KeyType <Primary | Secondary>
   ```

   While this cmdlet starts the key roll operation for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, the action doesn't complete immediately.

2. To see the progress of the key roll operation, run the Get-SPODataEncryptionPolicy cmdlet as follows:

   ```powershell
   Get-SPODataEncryptionPolicy -Identity <SPOAdminSiteUrl>
   ```

## Roll the availability key

Microsoft does not expose direct control of the availability key to customers. For example, you can only roll (rotate) the keys that you own in Azure Key Vault. To roll the availability key, you create a new DEP. Office 365 rolls the availability keys on an internally defined schedule. There is no customer-facing, service-level agreement (SLA) for these key rolls. Office 365 rotates the availability key using Office 365 service code in an automated, non-manual process. Microsoft administrators may initiate the roll process, but the key is rolled using automated mechanisms without authentication to the key store. Access to the availability key secret store is not provisioned to Microsoft administrators. Availability key rolling leverages the same mechanism used to initially generate the key. For more information about the availability key, see [Understand the availability key](customer-key-availability-key-understand.md).
