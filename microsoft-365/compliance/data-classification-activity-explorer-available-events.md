# Labeling activities that are available in Activity explorer

## Sensitivity label applied

This event is generated each time an unlabeled document is labeled or an email is sent with a label. 

- It is captured at the time of save in Office native applications and web applications. 
- It is captured at the time of occurrence in Azure Information protection add-ins. 
- Upgrade and downgrade labels actions can also be monitored via the *Label event type* field and filter. The *justification* text is also captured.

## Sensitivity label changed

This event is generated each time a label is updated on the document or email.

- For the AIP Unified client, Unified Scanner and MIP SDK sources, the AIP *upgrade label* and *downgrade label* action maps to activity explorer *label changed*

- It is captured at the point of save in Office native applications and web applications. 
- It is captured at the time of occurrence in Azure Information protection unified client add-ins and scanner enforcements
- Upgrade and downgrade labels actions can also be monitored via the *Label event type* field and filter. The *justification* text is also captured except for SharePoint Online and OneDrive.
- Sensitivity labeling done in Office native apps on Outlook collects the last action that was generated before file save/email send actions. For example, if the user changes label on an email multiple times before sending, the last label found on the email when it is sent will be captured in the activity explorer and audit logs.

- This event is captured at the time of save in Office native applications and web applications.
- It is captured at the time of occurrence in Azure Information protection add-ins.
