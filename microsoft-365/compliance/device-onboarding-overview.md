# Get started with device onboarding

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP)](./endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md)
- [Insider risk management](insider-risk-management.md#learn-about-insider-risk-management-in-microsoft-365)

Microsoft 365 Endpoint data loss prevention (Endpoint DLP) and insider risk management require that Windows 10 Windows 11, and macOS (Catalina 10.15 and higher) devices be onboarded into the service so that they can send monitoring data to the services.
 
Microsoft 365 Endpoint DLP allows you to monitor Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices and detect when sensitive items are used and shared. This gives you the visibility and control you need to ensure that they are used and protected properly, and to help prevent risky behavior that might compromise them. For more information about all of Microsoftâ€™s DLP offerings, see [Learn about data loss prevention](dlp-learn-about-dlp.md). To learn more about Endpoint DLP, see [Learn about Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md).

Insider risk management uses the full breadth of service and 3rd-party indicators to help you quickly identify, triage, and act on risky user activity. By using logs from Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Graph, insider risk management allows you to define specific policies to identify risk indicators and to take action to mitigate these risks. For more information, see [Learn about insider risk management in Microsoft 365](insider-risk-management.md#learn-about-insider-risk-management-in-microsoft-365).

Device onboarding is shared across Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). If you've already onboarded devices to MDE, they will appear in the managed devices list and no further steps are necessary to onboard those specific devices. Onboarding devices in Compliance center also onboards them into MDE.

## Before you begin

### SKU/subscriptions licensing

Check the licensing requirements for your solution.

### Permissions

To enable device management, the account you use must be a member of any one of these roles:

- Global admin
- Security admin
- Compliance admin

If you want to use a custom account to view the device management settings, it must be in one of these roles:

- Global admin
- Compliance admin
- Compliance data admin
- Global reader

If you want to use a custom account to access the onboarding/offboarding page, it must be in one of these roles:

- Global admin
- Compliance admin

If you want to use a custom account to turn on/off device monitoring, it must be in one of these roles:

- Global admin
- Compliance admin

### Prepare your macOS devices

See, [Onboard macOS devices into Microsoft 365 overview (preview)](device-onboarding-macos-overview.md#onboard-macos-devices-into-microsoft-365-overview-preview)

### Prepare your Windows devices

Make sure that the Windows devices that you need to onboard meet these requirements.

1. Must be running Windows 10 x64 build 1809 or later or Windows 11.

2. Antimalware Client Version is 4.18.2009.7 or newer. Check your current version by opening Windows Security app, select the Settings icon, and then select About. The version number is listed under Antimalware Client Version. Update to the latest Antimalware Client Version by installing Windows Update KB4052623.

   > [!NOTE]
   > None of Windows Security components need to be active, but the [Real-time protection and Behavior monitor](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus)) must be enabled.

3. The following Windows Updates for Windows 10 are installed for devices that will be monitored.

   > [!NOTE]
   > These updates are not a pre-requisite to onboard a device, but contain fixes for important issues thus must be installed before using the product.
   >
    > - For Windows 10 1809 - KB4559003, KB4577069, KB4580390
    > - For Windows 10 1903 or 1909 - KB4559004, KB4577062, KB4580386
    > - For Windows 10 2004 - KB4568831, KB4577063

4. All devices must be one of these:

   - [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join)
   - [Hybrid Azure AD joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid)
   - [AAD registered](/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-register-device-on-network)

5. For devices running Office 2016 (and not any other Office version) - KB4577063

6. If you are on Monthly Enterprise Channel of Microsoft 365 Apps versions 2004-2008, there is a known issue with classifying Office content and you need to update to version 2009 or later. See [Update history for Microsoft 365 Apps (listed by date)](/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date) for current versions. To learn more about this issue, see the Office Suite section of [Release notes for Current Channel releases in 2020](/officeupdates/current-channel#version-2010-october-27).

7. If you have endpoints that use a device proxy to connect to the internet, follow the procedures in [Configure device proxy and internet connection settings for Information Protection](device-onboarding-configure-proxy.md#configure-device-proxy-and-internet-connection-settings-for-information-protection).

## Onboarding devices into device management

You must enable device monitoring and onboard your endpoints before you can monitor and protect sensitive items on a device. Both of these actions are done in the Microsoft 365 Compliance portal.

When you want to onboard devices that haven't been onboarded yet, you'll download the appropriate script and deploy it to those devices. Follow the [Onboarding devices procedure](endpoint-dlp-getting-started.md#onboarding-devices).

If you already have devices onboarded into [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/), they will already appear in the managed devices list. <!--Follow the [With devices onboarded into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint procedure](?source=docs&view=o365-worldwide#with-devices-onboarded-into-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint).-->

### Onboarding Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices

In this deployment scenario, you'll onboard Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices that have not been onboarded yet.

1. Open the [Microsoft compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com) **Settings** page and choose **Enable device monitoring**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > While it usually takes about 60 seconds for device onboarding to be enabled, please allow up to 30 minutes before engaging with Microsoft support.

2. Open the Compliance Center settings page and choose **Onboard devices**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![enable device management.](../media/endpoint-dlp-learn-about-1-enable-device-management.png)

3. Choose **Device management** to open the **Devices** list. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you have previously deployed Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, all the devices that were onboarded during that process will be listed in the **Devices** list. There is no need to onboard them again.

4. Choose **Onboarding** to begin the onboarding process.

5. Choose the way you want to deploy to these additional devices from the **Deployment method** list and then **download package**.

6. Follow the appropriate procedures in [Onboarding tools and methods for Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices](device-onboarding.md#onboarding-tools-and-methods-for-windows-10-or-windows-11-devices).

Once an device is onboarded, it should be visible in the devices list and also start reporting audit activity logs to Activity explorer.

<!--### With devices onboarded into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this scenario, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is already deployed and there are devices reporting in. All these devices will appear in the managed devices list. You can continue to onboard new devices into Microsoft 365 information protection solution to expand coverage.

1. Open the [Microsoft compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com).

2. Open the Compliance Center settings page and choose **Enable device monitoring**.

3. Choose **Device management** to open the **Devices** list. You should see the list of devices that are already reporting in to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

4. Choose **Onboarding** if you need to onboard additional devices.

5. Choose the way you want to deploy to these additional devices from the **Deployment method** list and then **Download package**.

6. Follow the appropriate procedures in [Onboarding tools and methods for Windows 10 machines](/microsoft-365/compliance/device-onboarding.md). This link takes you to a landing page where you can access Microsoft 365 information protection device onboarding procedures that match the deployment package you selected in step 5:
