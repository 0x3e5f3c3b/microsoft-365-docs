# Get started with data loss prevention on-premises scanner

Microsoft data loss prevention on-premises scanner is part of the Microsoft 365 data loss prevention (DLP) suite of features you can use to discover and protect sensitive items across Microsoft 365 services. For more information about all of Microsoftâ€™s DLP offerings, see [Overview of data loss prevention](data-loss-prevention-policies.md). To learn more about Endpoint DLP, see [Learn about Endpoint data loss prevention](endpoint-dlp-learn-about.md)

On-premises scanner allows you to monitor on-premises data-at-rest in file shares and SharePoint document libraries and folders to detect when sensitive items are used and shared. This gives you the visibility and control you need to ensure that they are used and protected properly, and to help prevent risky behavior that might compromise them.

DLP on-premises scanner relies on a full implemenation of Azure Information Protection (AIP) scanner to monitor, label and protect sensitive items. If you aren't familiar with AIP scanner, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with it. See these articles:

- [What is Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection)
- [What is the Azure Information Protection unified labeling scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner)
- [Requirements for installing and deploying the Azure Information Protection unified labeling scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner-prereqs)
- [Configuring and installing the Azure Information Protection unified labeling scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install)


## Before you begin

Network discovery jobs configuration is optional step. You can skip it and define specific repositories to be scanned in your Content scan job.



### SKU/subscriptions licensing

Before you get started with DLP on-premises scanner, you should confirm your [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=1) and any add-ons. To participate in the preview the admin account that sets up the DLP rules must be assigned one of the following licenses:

- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance
- Microsoft 365 E5 Information Protection & Governance 
- EMS E5
- Azure Information Protection P2


### Permissions

Data from DLP on-premises scanner can be viewed in [Activity explorer](data-classification-activity-explorer.md). There are four roles that grant permission to activity explorer, the account you use for accessing the data must be a member of any one of them.

- Global administrator
- Compliance administrator
- Security administrator
- Compliance data administrator

### Scanner prerequisites

- AIP scanner implements DLP policy matching and policy enforcement. See [Requirements for installing and deploying the Azure Information Protection unified labeling scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner-prereqs).
- Deploy AIP scanner, see [Configuring and installing the Azure Information Protection unified labeling scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install).
- There must be at least one label and policy published in the tenant, even if all your detection rules are based on sensitive information types only.





## Next steps
Now that you have onboarded devices and can view the activity data in Activity explorer, you are ready to move on to your next step where you create DLP policies that protect your sensitive items.
