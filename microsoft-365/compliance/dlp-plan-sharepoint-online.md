### Policy evaluation in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online sites

Across all of your SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive for Business sites, documents are constantly changing â€” they're continually being created, edited, shared, and so on. This means documents can conflict or become compliant with a DLP policy at any time. For example, a person can upload a document that contains no sensitive information to their team site, but later, a different person can edit the same document and add sensitive information to it.
  
For this reason, DLP policies check documents for policy matches frequently in the background. You can think of this as asynchronous policy evaluation.
  
#### How it works
 
As people add or change documents in their sites, the search engine scans the content, so that you can search for it later. While this is happening, the content's also scanned for sensitive information and to check if it's shared. Any sensitive information that's found is stored securely in the search index, so that only the compliance team can access it, but not typical users. Each DLP policy that you've turned on runs in the background (asynchronously), checking search frequently for any content that matches a policy, and applying actions to protect it from inadvertent leaks.

Finally, documents can conflict with a DLP policy, but they can also become compliant with a DLP policy. For example, if a person adds credit card numbers to a document, it might cause a DLP policy to block access to the document automatically. But if the person later removes the sensitive information, the action (in this case, blocking) is automatically undone the next time the document is evaluated against the policy.
  
DLP evaluates any content that can be indexed. For more information on what file types are crawled by default, see [Default crawled file name extensions and parsed file types in SharePoint Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/technical-reference/default-crawled-file-name-extensions-and-parsed-file-types).

> [!NOTE]
> External sharing of new files in SharePoint can be blocked by default until at least one DLP policy scans the new item. See, [Mark new files as sensitive by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/sensitive-by-default) for detailed information.
