# Download documents from a review set

Download offers a simple way to download content from a review set in Native format. It leverages the browser's data transfer features so a browser prompt will appear once a download is ready. Files downloaded using this method will be zipped into a container file and will be item level files. This means that if you select an attachment, you will automatically receive the email with the attachment included. Similarly, if you select an excel spreadsheet that was embedded in a word document, you will receive the word document with the excel spreadsheet embedded. Downloaded items will preserve the last modified date which can be viewed as a file property.

To download content from a review set, start by selecting the files you want to download then select "Download" under the Actions menu.
