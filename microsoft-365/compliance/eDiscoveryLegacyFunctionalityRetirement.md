**eDiscovery Legacy Functionality Retirement**

Over the years, Microsoft has provided eDiscovery tools that let you search, preview, and export email content from Exchange Online. However, these tools no longer offer an effective way to search for non-Exchange content in other Office 365 services, such as SharePoint Online and Office 365 Groups. To address this, Microsoft offers other eDiscovery tools that help you search for a wide variety of Office 365 content. And we've been working hard to incorporate the most current and powerful eDiscovery functionality in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com). This allows organizations to respond to legal, internal, and other document requests for content across many Office 365 services, including Exchange Online.

As a result of this new and improved eDiscovery functionality in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, we're retiring the following eDiscovery-related features and functionality related to searching for email content:

- [In-Place eDiscovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/security-and-compliance/in-place-ediscovery/in-place-ediscovery) and [In-Place Holds](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/security-and-compliance/create-or-remove-in-place-holds) in the Exchange admin center.

- The Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets that support In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Holds (these cmdlets are collectively identified as **-MailboxSearch* cmdlets). This includes the following cmdlets:

  - [New-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/new-mailboxsearch)

  - [Start-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/start-mailboxsearch)

  - [Stop-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/stop-mailboxsearch)

  - [Set-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/set-mailboxsearch)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The [Get-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/get-mailboxsearch) and [Remove-MailboxSearch](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/remove-mailboxsearch) cmdlets will be available after the other ****-MailboxSearch*** cmdlets are retired so that you can use them to help in your transition to other eDiscovery and hold tools. However, after a certain date (cited below) Microsoft Support will no longer supports these two cmdlets.

- The GetSearchableMailboxes, SetHoldOnMailboxes, and GetHoldOnMailboxes operations in the Exchange Web Services API.
  
- The [Search-Mailbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/search-mailbox?view=exchange-ps) cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell.

- [Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery v1.0](office-365-advanced-ediscovery.md), which is the first version of Advanced eDiscovery that's accessed through an eDiscovery case in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.

> [!NOTE]
> The eDiscovery functionality being retired only applies to cloud-based versions of Microsoft 365 and Office 365. eDiscovery functionality in on-premises versions of Exchange and SharePoint will still be supported until further notice.

The following sections in this article provide guidance about each feature being retired. This information including timelines and alternative tools that you can use instead of the retired tool.

## In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Holds in the Exchange admin center 

As per the original announcement on July 1, 2017, the In-Place eDiscovery & Hold functionality in the Exchange admin center (EAC) is being retired. The In-Place eDiscovery & Holds page in the EAC allowed you to search, hold, and export content from Exchange Online. In-Place eDiscovery also let you copy search results to a discovery mailbox so that you or other eDiscovery managers could review content and make it available for legal, regulatory, and public requests.

Becuase all of these capabilities (except for copying search results to a discovery mailbox) are now available in the content search, eDiscovery and Advanced eDiscovery tools in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) (with improved functionality, reliability, and support for a wide range of Microsoft 365 services), we recommend that you start using these tools as soon as possible. To help you in the transition to these other eDiscovery tools, the table below lists the tools you can use instead of In-Place eDiscovery and In-Place Hold.

### Scope of affected organzizations
    
- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 organizations in a multi-tenant datacenter environment

- Office 365 and Microsoft 365 organizations in a GoLocal datacenter environment

### Timeline for retirement
    
- April 1, 2020: You won't be able to create new searches and holds, but you can still run, edit, and delete existing searches at your own risk. Microsoft Support will no longer In-Place eDiscovery & Holds in the EAC.
    
- July 1, 2020: The In-Place eDiscovery & Holds functionality in the EAC will be placed in a read-only mode. This means you'll only be able to remove existing searches and holds.

### Alternative tools

The following table describes other eDiscovery tools that you can use to replace the existing functionality that's being retired.

### FAQ

**I use the copy search results functionality in the Exchange admin center In-Place eDiscovery & Holds to copy search results to a discovery mailbox for review by attorneys. What options do I have now?**

There are two ways to provide this functionality today. First is to use [Review Sets in Advanced eDiscovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/view-documents-in-review-set). Review sets have many capabilities you would see in a traditional review tool like lightning fast search, tagging, email threading, near duplicate grouping, themes analysis and predictive coding. Alternatively, if you are still interested in using discovery mailboxes for review, you can export from the Microsoft 365 compliance center and then import the data using the [PST import feature](use-network-upload-to-import-pst-files.md) offered by Data Governance.

**How do I control users that can an eDiscovery manager can search, this was done using RBAC in the past?**

The Microsoft 365 compliance center uses [compliance boundaries](set-up-compliance-boundaries.md) to control the searchable scope of an eDiscovery Manager. Compliance boundaries are very useful in government entities who need to separate along agency boundaries or multi-national corporations who are required to respect geographical boarders.

**How can I automate the transition of my searches and holds to the Microsoft 365 compliance center?**

It is possible to migrate searches and holds from the Exchange admin center In-Place eDiscovery & Holds using PowerShell, see this help topic to learn more - [ Automating migration of Searches & Holds from the Exchange admin center to the Microsoft 365 compliance center](onenote:#Automating%20migration%20of%20Searches%20%20Holds%20from%20the%20Exchange%20Admin%20Center%20to%20the%20Microsoft%20365%20Compliance%20Center&section-id={AC50DB66-61C5-4D74-806C-39FF31F9201C}&page-id={84B2952C-5A28-4B7E-BE3A-C1705BDDCE89}&end&base-path=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/eDiscoveryvNext/SiteAssets/eDiscovery%20vNext%20Notebook/Marshal's%20Specs.one).

## \*-MailboxSearch cmdlets

As per the original notice announced in July 1, 2017 in the Exchange admin center, the In-Place eDiscovery & Hold functionality and the corresponding **\*-MailboxSearch** cmdlets are being retired. These cmdlets provide users the ability to search, hold, and export mailbox content for legal, regulatory and public requests.

Because these capabilities are now available in the [<span class="underline">Microsoft 365 compliance center</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) and Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell with improved performance and scalability, you should begin taking advantage of the improved cmdlets. These cmdlets include [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceCase</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-ediscovery/get-compliancecase?view=exchange-ps), [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceSearch</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/get-compliancesearch?view=exchange-ps), [<span class="underline">\*-CaseHoldPolicy</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-ediscovery/get-caseholdpolicy?view=exchange-ps), [<span class="underline">\*-CaseHoldRule</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-ediscovery/get-caseholdrule?view=exchange-ps), and [<span class="underline">\*-ComplianceSearchAction</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-content-search/get-compliancesearchaction?view=exchange-ps).

### FAQ

**We used Copy Search to export Email or Instant Messages for purposes other than In-Place eDiscovery, what other options do I have?**

The [<span class="underline">Microsoft Graph APIs</span>](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) provide a number of methods for extracting data for analysis and other purposes which are far more resilient and scalable than the **\*-MailboxSearch** cmdlets.

**How can I automate the transition of my searches and holds to the Microsoft 365 compliance center?**

It is possible to migrate searches and holds from the Exchange admin center In-Place eDiscovery & Holds using PowerShell, see this help topic to learn more - [<span class="underline">Automating migration of Searches & Holds from the Exchange admin center to the Microsoft 365 compliance center</span>](onenote:#Automating%20migration%20of%20Searches%20%20Holds%20from%20the%20Exchange%20Admin%20Center%20to%20the%20Microsoft%20365%20Compliance%20Center&section-id={AC50DB66-61C5-4D74-806C-39FF31F9201C}&page-id={84B2952C-5A28-4B7E-BE3A-C1705BDDCE89}&end&base-path=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/eDiscoveryvNext/SiteAssets/eDiscovery%20vNext%20Notebook/Marshal's%20Specs.one).

**After the cmdlets are retired, will I still be able to remove or retrieve searches?**

Yes, although we're removing the ability to create and modify searches, you will still be able to use Get-Mailbox search and Remove-Mailbox search until further notice. However, the use of these cmdlets will be at your own risk after the retirement dates and Microsoft support will no longer be able to provide assistance.

## GetSearchableMailboxes, SetHoldOnMailboxes, GetHoldOnMailboxes Operations

These three Exchange Web Services APIs are utilized by the Exchange admin center In-Place eDiscovery & Holds user interface and the corresponding **\*-MailboxSearch** cmdlets. They will also be retired as part of retiring the legacy eDiscovery tools.

## Search-Mailbox cmdlet

Search-Mailbox is being retired as originally announced in a warning in the cmdlet output in 2018. Search-Mailbox was originally used to search a user's mailbox and purge malicious content. We recommend you transition your usage to the Microsoft Compliance Center \*-ComplianceSearch & \*-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlets. For a built in security experience, [<span class="underline">Microsoft 365 Security</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/) provides robust threat protection against email and many other Microsoft services.

## Advanced eDiscovery v1.0

Advanced eDiscovery v1.0, which is the version of Advanced eDiscovery available in an eDiscovery case by clicking **Switch to Advanced eDiscovery** is being retired in favor of the new [Advanced eDiscovery solution](https://aka.ms/edisco) in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

The new Advanced eDiscovery solution in Microsoft 365 provides all of the capabilities of the original solution, but now includes a custodian based approach to identifying data within the Microsoft Services, collecting that data and promoting it to a Review Set where reviewers can take advantage of lightning fast search, tagging, and analytics features to help cull relevant documents. Advanced eDiscovery now includes improved processing and native viewers for both Microsoft and non-Microsoft file types, a full list of file types is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/supported-filetypes-ediscovery20) and supported metadata fields are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/document-metadata-fields-in-advanced-ediscovery). Also, the new Advanced eDiscovery solution provides robust custodian holds management features to apply holds, notify users of the holds, and track responses right in the application.

At this time, we recommended that you begin to transition you eDiscovery workflow to the new Advanced eDiscovery functionality. Although youâll still be able to access Advanced eDiscovery v1.0 in existing cases, Microsoft Support wonât provide support after July 1, 2020. See the following timeline for more details.
