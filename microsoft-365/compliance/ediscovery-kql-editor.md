# Use the KQL editor to build search queries

The new KQL query experience in Microsoft 365 eDiscovery tools search provides feedback and guidance when you build search queries in Content search, Core eDiscovery, and Advanced eDiscovery. When you type queries in the editor, it provides auto-completion for supported searchable properties and conditions and provides lists of supported values for standard properties and conditions. For example, if you specify the `kind` email property in your query, the editor will present a list of supported values that you can select. The KQL editor also displays potential query errors in real-time that you can fix before you run the search. Best of all, you can paste complex queries directly into the editor without having to manually build queries using the keywords and conditions cards.
