# Use the query builder to create search queries (preview)

The query builder option in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery search provides a visual filtering experience when you build search queries in eDiscovery (Premium). Use the new query builder to construct complex queries with additional functionality, including AND, OR, and grouping of conditions. These features in the query builder help you build queries more effectively, provide a visual interface for grouping sub-queries, and provide additional space for complex keyword queries to be constructed and reviewed.

[!INCLUDE [purview-preview](../includes/purview-preview.md)]

## Displaying the query builder

When you create or edit an eDiscovery search for a collection, the option to display and use the query builder is located on the **Search query** page in the collections wizard. Select **Use new query builder** to display and use the query builder.
