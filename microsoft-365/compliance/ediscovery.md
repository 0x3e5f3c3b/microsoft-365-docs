# Microsoft 365 eDiscovery solutions

Electronic discovery, or eDiscovery, is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases. You can use eDiscovery tools in Microsoft 365 to search for content in Exchange Online, Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business sites, and Yammer teams. You can search mailboxes and sites in the same eDiscovery search by using the Content search tool. And you can use Core eDiscovery cases to identify, hold, and export content found in mailboxes and sites. If your organization has an Office 365 E5 or Microsoft 365 E5 subscription (or related E5 add-on subscriptions), you can further manage custodians and analyze content by using the Advanced eDiscovery solution in Microsoft 365.
  
## Microsoft 365 eDiscovery solutions

Microsoft 365 provides three eDiscovery solutions:
  
- [Content search](#content-search)

- [Core eDiscovery](#core-ediscovery)

- [Advanced eDiscovery](#advanced-ediscovery)


## Comparison of key capabilities

The following table compares the key capabilities available in Content search, Core eDiscovery, and Advanced eDiscovery. 

|Capability|Content search|Core eDiscovery|Advanced eDiscovery|
|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
|||||
|||||

Here's description of the key eDiscovery capabilities.

- **Search for content**. Search for content that's stored in Exchange mailboxes, One Drive for Business accounts, SharePoint sites, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Yammer Teams. This includes content generated by other Microsoft 365 apps that store data in mailboxes and sites.

- **Keyword queries and search conditions**. Create KQL keyword search queries to search for content that match query criteria. You can also include conditions to narrow the scope of your search.

- **Search statistics**. After you run a search, you can view statistics of the estimated search results, such as the number and total size of items matching your search criteria. Additional statistics include the top content locations that contain search results and the number of items that match different parts of the search query.

- **Export search results**. Export search results to a local computer in your organization in a two-step process. When you export search results, items are copied from their original content location in Microsoft 365 to a Microsoft-provided Azure Storage location. Then you can download those items to a local computer.

- **Role-based permissions**. Use role-based access (RBAC) permissions to control what eDiscovery-related tasks that different users can perform. You can users to built-in eDiscovery-related role group or create custom role groups that assign specific eDiscovery permissions.

- **Case management**. eDiscovery cases in Core eDiscovery and Advanced eDiscovery let you associate specific searches and exports with a specific investigation. You can also assign members to a case to control who can access the case and view the contents of the case.

- **Place content locations on legal hold**. Preserve content relevant to your investigation by placing a legal hold on the content locations in a case. This lets you secure electronically stored information from inadvertent (or intentional) deletion during your investigation.

- **Custodian management**. Manage the people that you've identified as persons of interest in the case (called *custodians*) and other data sources that may not be associated with a custodian. When you add custodians and non-custodial data sources to a case, you can place a legal hold on these data sources, communicate with custodians by using the legal hold notification process, and search custodian and non-custodial data sources to collect content relevant to the case. Additionally, when you add custodial and non-custodian data sources to a case, the assoicated content location are re-indexed (in a process called *Advanced indexing*) so that any content that was deemed as partially indexed is reprocessed to make it fully searchable.

- **Legal hold notifications**. Manage the process of communicating with case custodians. A legal hold notification instructs custodians to preserve content that's relevant to the case. You can track the notices that have been received, read, and acknowledged by custodians. The communications workflow in Advanced eDiscovery allows you to create and send initial notifications, reminders, and escalations if custodians fail to acknowledge a hold notification.

- **Error remediation**. 

- **Advanced indexing**. 

- **Support for modern attachments and SharePoint versions**. 

- **Optical character recognition**. 

- **Collection statistics and reports**. 

- **Review sets**. 

- **Conversation reconstruction**. 

- **Review set queries and filtering**. 

- **Tagging and annotations**. 

- **Document metadata**. 

- **Analytics such as email threading, themes, and near-duplicate detection**. 

- **Predictive coding models**. 

- **Job management**. 

- **Export to customer Azure Storage location**.
