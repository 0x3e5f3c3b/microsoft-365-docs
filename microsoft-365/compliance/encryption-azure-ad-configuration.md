# Azure AD configuration for encrypted content

If you protect sensitive items such as emails and documents by using encryption from the Azure Rights Management Service from [Microsoft Purview Information Protection](information-protection.md), there are some Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) configurations that can prevent authorized access to this encrypted content.

Similarly, if your users receive encrypted email from another organization or collaborate with other organizations that encrypt documents by using the Azure Rights Management Service, your users might not be able to open that email or document because of how their Azure AD is configured.

For example:

- A user can't open encrypted email sent from another organization. Or, a user reports that the recipients in another organization can't open an encrypted email that they sent them.

- Your organization collaborates with another organization on a joint project, and project documents are protected by encrypting them, granting access by using groups in Azure AD. Users can't open the documents encrypted by users in the other organization.

- Users can successfully open an encrypted document when they are in the office, but can't when they try to access this document remotely and they're prompted for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

To ensure access to the encryption service isn't inadvertently blocked, use the following sections to help configure your organization's Azure AD, or relay the information to an Azure AD administrator in another organization. Without access to this service, users can't be authenticated and authorized to open encrypted content.

## Cross-tenant access settings and encrypted content

By default, there's nothing to configure for cross-tenant authentication to work when users protect content by using encryption from the Azure Rights Management Service. However, your organization can restrict access by using Azure AD [External Identities cross-tenant access settings](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview). Conversely, another organization can also configure these settings to restrict access with users in your organization. These settings affect opening any encrypted items, which include encrypted emails and encrypted documents.

For example, another organization might have settings configured that prevent their users from opening content encrypted by your organization. In this scenario, until their Azure AD admin reconfigures their cross-tenant settings, an external user attempting to open that content will see a message that informs them **Access is blocked by the organization** with an email address to contact to request access. 

Whenever cross-tenant access settings restrict access by applications, they must be configured to allow access to **Microsoft Azure Information Protection**, which has the following an app ID:

````plaintext
00000012-0000-0000-c000-000000000000
````

If this access isn't allowed, users can't be authenticated and authorized to open encrypted content. This configuration can be set as a default setting and as an organizational setting:

- To permit sharing of encrypted content with another organization, create an inbound setting that allows access to Microsoft Azure Information Protection (ID: 00000012-0000-0000-c000-000000000000). 

- To permit access to encrypted content that users receive from other organizations, create an outbound setting that allows access to Microsoft Azure Information Protection (ID: 00000012-0000-0000-c000-000000000000)

When these settings are configured for Microsoft Azure Information Protection, the application displays **Microsoft Rights Management Services**.

For instructions to configure these cross-tenant access settings, see [Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration).

If you have also configured Azure AD Conditional Access policies that require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users, see the following section how to configure Conditional Access for encrypted content.

## Conditional Access policies and encrypted content

If your organization has implemented [Azure Active Directory Conditional Access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) that include **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** and the policy extends to external users:

- For external users who have an Azure AD account in their own tenant, we recommend you use [External Identities cross-tenant access settings](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview) to configure trust claims from one, many, or all external Azure AD organizations.
- 
- For external users not covered by the previous entry, for example, users who don't have an Azure AD account or you haven't configured cross-tenant access settings for trust claims, these external users must have a guest account in your tenant.
    
Without one of these configurations, external users won't be able to open the encrypted content and will see an error message. The message text might inform them that their account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant, with the incorrect instruction for this scenario to **Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account**.

If you can't meet these configuration requirements for external users who need to open content encrypted by your organization, you must either remove Microsoft Azure Information Protection from the Conditional Access policies, or exclude external users from the policies.
