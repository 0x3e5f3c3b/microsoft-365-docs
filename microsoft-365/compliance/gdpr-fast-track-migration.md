# FastTrack Migration Toolset for Submitting Delete Request

## Toolset purpose

In the event that you are a customer currently engaged in FastTrack migrations, deleting the Office 365 user account will not delete the data copy held by the Microsoft FastTrack team, which is held for the sole purpose of completing the migration. If, during the migration, you would like the Microsoft FastTrack team to also delete the data copy, submit a request via this toolset. In the ordinary course of business, Microsoft FastTrack will delete all data copies once the migration is complete.
