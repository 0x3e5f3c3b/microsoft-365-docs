# GDPR

The journey to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance begins with a set of defined steps. The information on this page is designed to help both compliance professionals and IT implementers understand how Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows Server can assist you in discovering, managing, and protecting your data in the cloud, and compiling the necessary reports and documentation to help meet GDPR requirements.

Compliance is an on-going process and a shared responsibility. Microsoft Windows operating systems offer a powerful set of tools and extensive documentation on how to use them to make the process easier. Microsoft is investing in additional features and functionality to help organizations achieve their GDPR goals.

Whether you’re a compliance officer, a decision-maker considering Windows as a client/server solution, a current Windows administrator seeking help with specific GDPR-compliant implementation, or an interested party looking for general information on how the GDPR relates to Windows, the information here can provide a starting point for your journey.

Your path to GDPR compliance begins with focusing on four key steps. Microsoft Windows products and services provide powerful tools and solutions for tackling each step. Find out more about how Microsoft products and services can help you on the road to GDPR compliance.

## Discover
The first steps toward General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance is to assess whether the GDPR applies to your organization, and, if so, what data under your control is subject to the GDPR. This analysis includes understanding what data you have and where it resides. Adopting a classification scheme that applies throughout your organization helps you respond to data subject requests because it enables you to identify more readily and process personal data requests.
* Administrators can use PowerShell string-matching or regex queries to search for and identify personal data in some file types in local or connected storage.
* Azure Information Protection (AIP) enables classification, labeling, and protection of data in local storage and in Windows * Server file servers that support File Classification Infrastructure (FCI).
Windows Server administrators can deploy automatic file classification in Active Directory to create personal data classification rules, and then assign values to the resource properties for files on the file server.

## Manage
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides data subjects—individuals to whom data relates—with more control over how their personal data is captured and used. Microsoft Windows enables data governance practices and processes via built-in permissions and access controls, along with Azure Rights Management Services (RMS).
* Administrators can use Windows permissions to manage the authorization of users, groups, and computers to access network objects and object properties.
* Domain-based Dynamic Access Control (DAC) enables you to apply and enforce access-control permissions and restrictions based on well-defined rules that can include the sensitivity of the resources, the job or role of the user, and the configuration of the device that is used to access these resources.
* With Azure RMS in Azure Information Protection (AIP), you can assign and enforce persistent restrictions on sharing files that contain personal data, as well as enforce encryption requirements.
* Organizations can host customized privacy notices within their individual public-facing applications on the Windows platform. Plus, Windows can run applications or house other technologies used to obtain consent for relevant processing activities.
* You can use Windows Search or PowerShell to locate and discontinue processing of files containing personal data, to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data or erase personal data when requested, and to restrict processing of personal data.
* You can use the native data export features of Windows 10 to manually transfer data in a variety of file formats.
Windows provides a platform for accessing applications such as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 that can help you track and manage Data Subject Rights requests.
