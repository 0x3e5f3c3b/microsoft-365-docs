# Get started with sensitivity labels

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

For information about what sensitivity labels are and how they can help you protect your organization's data, see [Learn about sensitivity labels](sensitivity-labels.md).

If you have [Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection), determine whether you need to migrate labels to the unified labeling platform, and which labeling client to use:
- [How can I determine if my tenant is on the unified labeling platform?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/faqs#how-can-i-determine-if-my-tenant-is-on-the-unified-labeling-platform)
- [Choose which labeling client to use for Windows computers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/rms-client/use-client#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use-for-windows-computers)

When you're ready to start protecting your organization's data by using sensitivity labels:

1. **Create the labels.** Create and name your sensitivity labels according to your organization's classification taxonomy for different sensitivity levels of content. Use common names or terms that make sense to your users. If you don't already have an established taxonomy, consider starting with label names such as Personal, Public, General, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. You can then use sublabels to group similar labels by category. When you create a label, use the  tooltip text to help users select the appropriate label.
    
    For more extensive guidance for defining a classificaton taxonomy, download the white paper, "Data Classification & Sensitivity Label Taxonomy" from the [Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/DataClassificationWhitepaper).

2. **Define what each label can do.** Configure the protection settings you want associated with each label. For example, you might want lower sensitivity content (such as a "General" label) to have just a header or footer applied, while higher sensitivity content (such as a "Confidential" label) should have a watermark, encryption, and endpoint protection applied.

3. **Publish the labels.** After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable â€” you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users. So for example, you could pilot your sensitivity labels by assigning a label policy to just a few users. Then when you're ready to roll out the labels across your organization, you can create a new label policy for your labels and this time, specify all users.

The basic flow for deploying and applying sensitivity labels:

## Subscription and licensing requirements for sensitivity labels

A number of different subscriptions support sensitivity labels and the licensing requirements for users depend on the features you use.

To see the options for licensing your users to benefit from Microsoft 365 compliance features as of April 1, 2020, see the [Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD). For sensitivity labels, see the [Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection) section and related PDF or Excel download.

## Permissions required to create and manage sensitivity labels

Members of your compliance team who will create sensitivity labels need permissions to the Microsoft 365 compliance center, Microsoft 365 security center, or the Security & Compliance Center. 

By default, global administrators for your tenant have access to these admin centers and can give compliance officers and other people access, without giving them all of the permissions of a tenant admin. For this delegated limited admin access, go to the **Permissions** page of one of these admin centers, and then add members to the **Compliance Data Administrator**, **Compliance Administrator** or **Security Administrator** role group.

Alternatively to using roles, you can create a new role group and add either **Sensitivity Label Administrator** or **Organization Configuration** roles to this group. For a read-only role, use **Sensitivity Label Reader**. For instructions, see [Give users access to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center).

These permissions are required only to create and configure sensitivity labels and their label policies. They are not required to apply the labels in apps or services.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sensitivity Label Reader** is a new role that initially supported just the PowerShell labeling cmdlets. Support for the admin labeling centers is now rolling out to tenants.
