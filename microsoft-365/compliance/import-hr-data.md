# Set up a connector to import HR data

You can set up a data connector in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to import human resources (HR) data, such as the date an employee submitted their resignation and date of the employee's last day. This HR data can then be used by Microsoft information protection solutions, such as the new Insider Risk Management tool, to help protect your organization from malicious activity or data theft inside your organization. Setting up an HR connector consists of creating an app in Azure Active Directory that's used for authentication by connector, creating a CSV mapping files that contains your HR data, creating a data connector in the compliance center, and then running a script (on a scheduled basis) that ingests the HR data in the CSV file to the Microsoft cloud. Then the data connector is used by a solution such as Insider Risk Management to access the HR data that was imported to Microsoft 365.
