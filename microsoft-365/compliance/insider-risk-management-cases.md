# Insider risk management cases (preview)

Cases are the heart of insider risk management and allow you to deeply investigate and take action on issues generated by risk signals defined in your policies. Cases are manually created from alerts in the situations where further action is needed to address a compliance-related issue for an employee. Each case is scoped to a single employee and multiple alerts for the employee can be added to an existing case or to a new case. After investigating the details of a case, you can take action by sending the employee a notice, resolving the case as benign, or escalating to a data or employee investigation.

## Case dashboard

The insider risk management case dashboard allows you to view and take action on cases. Each report widget on the dashboard displays information for last 30 days.

- **Active cases**: The total number of active cases under investigation.
- **Cases over time**: The total number of cases created, sorted Active and Closed status.
- **Statistics**: A summary of useful case statistics:
    - Average time of active cases.

The case queue lists all active and closed cases for your organization, in addition to the current state of the following case attributes:

- **Case name**: The name of the case, prefixed with the case sequence number and appended with the  
- **Status**: The status of the case, either *Active* or *Clsoed*.
- **User**: The employee for the case, either the employee name or a pseudonymized alias.
- **Time case opened**: The time that has passed since the case was opened.
- **Total policy violation alerts**: The number of policy matches included in the case. This number may increase if new alerts are added to the case.
- **Last updated**: The time that has passed since there has been an added case note or change in the case state.
- **Last updated by**: The name of the risk analyst or data investigator that last updated the case.

Use the search control to search case names for specific text and use the case filter to sort cases by the following attributes:

- Status
- Time case opened, start and end dates
- Last updated, start and end dates

## Investigate a case

Deeper investigation into insider risk management alerts is critical to taking proper corrective actions. Insider risk management cases are the central management tool to dive deeper into employee risk activity history and alert details, and to explore the content and messages exposed to risks. Risk analysts and investigators also use cases to centralize review feedback and notes and to process case resolution. Selecting a case opens the case management tools and allows analysts and investigators to dig into the details of cases.

### Case overview

The **Case overview** tab summarizes the alert activity and risk level history for the case. The **Alerts** widget shows the policy matches for the case, including the status of the alert, the alert risk severity, and when the alert was detected. The **Risk level history** chart displays the user risk level over the last 30 days. The line chart allows analysts and investigators to quick see the trend in overall user risk over time. The **risk activity content** widget summarizes the types of data and content contained in alerts added to the case. This give an all-up view of the entire data and content set at risk in the case.

The **Case details** pane is available on all case management tabs and summarizes the case details for risk analysts and investigators. It includes the following areas:

- **Case name**: The name of the case, prefixed with an auto-generated case sequence number and the name of the risk associated with the policy template that the first confirmed alert matches. 
- **Case status**: The current status of the case, either *Active* or *Closed*.
- **Current user risk level**: The current calculated risk level of the user for the case. This score is calculated every 24 hours and uses the alert risk scores from all active alerts associated to the user.
- **Alerts confirmed**: List of alerts for the user confirmed for the case. 
- **Content at risk**: List of content, sorted by content sources and types. For example, for case alert content in SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams, you may see channel, project, folder, or file names listed that are associated with the risk activity for alerts in the case.

### Alerts

The **Alerts** tab summarizes the current alerts included in the case. New alerts may be added to an existing case and they will be added to the **Policy match alert** queue as they are assigned. The following alert attributes are listed the queue:

- Status
- Alert risk severity
- Time detected

Select an alert from the queue to display the **Alert detail** page. 

Use the search control to search alert names for specific text and use the alert filter to sort cases by the following attributes:

- Status
- Risk severity
- Time detected, start and end dates

### User activity

The **User activity** tab is one of the most powerful tools for internal risk analysis and investigation for cases in the insider risk management solution. This tab is structured to enable a quick view of a case, including a historical timeline of alerts, alerts details, the current risk score for the user in the case, and controls to take effective action to contain the risks in the case.

1. **Date and window time filters**: By default, the last 6 months of alerts confirmed in the case are displayed in the User activity chart. You can easily filter the chart view with either the slider controls at both ends of the chart window, or by defining specific start and end dates in the chart filter control.
2. **Risk alert activity and details**: Risk activities are visually displayed as colored bubbles in the User activity chart. Bubbles are created for different categories of risk and bubble size is proportional to the number of risk activities for the category. Select a bubble to display the details for each risk activity. Details include:
    - **Date** of the risk activity.
    - The **risk activity category**. For example, *Email(s) with attachments sent outside the organization* or *File(s) downloaded from SharePoint Online*.
    - **Risk score** for the alert. This score is the numerical score for the alert risk severity level.
    - Number of **files** or **emails** associated with the alert. Links to each file or email associated with the risk activity is also available.
3. **Risk activity legend**: Across the bottom of the USer activity chart, a color-coded legend helps you quickly determine risk category for each alert.
4. **Risk activity chronology**: The full chronology of all risk alerts associated with the case are listed, including all the details available in the corresponding alert bubble.
5. **Case actions**: Options for resolving the case are on the case action toolbar. You can resolve a case, send an email notice to the employee, or escalate the case for a data or employee investigation.
6. **Case export**: You can export all alerts and alert details to a CSV for a case.
