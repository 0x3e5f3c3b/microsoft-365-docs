# Insider risk management cases (preview)

Cases are the heart of insider risk management and allow you to deeply investigate and take action on issues generated by risk signals defined in your policies. Cases are manually created from alerts in the situations where further action is needed to address a compliance-related issue for an employee. Each case is scoped to a single employee and multiple alerts for the employee can be added to an existing case or to a new case. After investigating the details of a case, you can take action by sending the employee a notice, resolving the case as benign, or escalating to a data or employee investigation.

## Case dashboard

The insider risk management case dashboard allows you to view and take action on cases. Each report widget on the dashboard displays information for last 30 days.

- **Active cases**: The total number of active cases under investigation.
- **Cases over time**: The total number of cases created, sorted Active and Closed status.
- **Statistics**: A summary of useful case statistics:
    - Average time of active cases.

The case queue lists all active and closed cases for your organization, in addition to the current state of the following case attributes:

- **Case name**: The name of the case, prefixed with the case sequence number and appended with the  
- **Status**: The status of the case, either *Active* or *Closed*.
- **User**: The employee for the case, either the employee name or a pseudonymized alias.
- **Time case opened**: The time that has passed since the case was opened.
- **Total policy violation alerts**: The number of policy matches included in the case. This number may increase if new alerts are added to the case.
- **Last updated**: The time that has passed since there has been an added case note or change in the case state.
- **Last updated by**: The name of the risk analyst or data investigator that last updated the case.

Use the search control to search case names for specific text and use the case filter to sort cases by the following attributes:

- Status
- Time case opened, start and end dates
- Last updated, start and end dates

## Investigate a case

Deeper investigation into insider risk management alerts is critical to taking proper corrective actions. Insider risk management cases are the central management tool to dive deeper into employee risk activity history and alert details, and to explore the content and messages exposed to risks. Risk analysts and investigators also use cases to centralize review feedback and notes and to process case resolution. Selecting a case opens the case management tools and allows analysts and investigators to dig into the details of cases.

### Case overview

The **Case overview** tab summarizes the alert activity and risk level history for the case. The **Alerts** widget shows the policy matches for the case, including the status of the alert, the alert risk severity, and when the alert was detected. The **Risk level history** chart displays the user risk level over the last 30 days. The line chart allows analysts and investigators to quick see the trend in overall user risk over time. The **risk activity content** widget summarizes the types of data and content contained in alerts added to the case. This gives an all-up view of the entire data and content set at risk in the case.

The **Case details** pane is available on all case management tabs and summarizes the case details for risk analysts and investigators. It includes the following areas:

- **Case name**: The name of the case, prefixed with an autogenerated case sequence number and the name of the risk associated with the policy template that the first confirmed alert matches. 
- **Case status**: The current status of the case, either *Active* or *Closed*.
- **Current user risk level**: The current calculated risk level of the user for the case. This score is calculated every 24 hours and uses the alert risk scores from all active alerts associated to the user.
- **Alerts confirmed**: List of alerts for the user confirmed for the case. 
- **Content at risk**: List of content, sorted by content sources and types. For example, for case alert content in SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams, you may see channel, project, folder, or file names listed that are associated with the risk activity for alerts in the case.

### Alerts

The **Alerts** tab summarizes the current alerts included in the case. New alerts may be added to an existing case and they will be added to the **Policy match alert** queue as they are assigned. The following alert attributes are listed the queue:

- Status
- Alert risk severity
- Time detected

Select an alert from the queue to display the **Alert detail** page. 

Use the search control to search alert names for specific text and use the alert filter to sort cases by the following attributes:

- Status
- Risk severity
- Time detected, start and end dates

### User activity

The **User activity** tab is one of the most powerful tools for internal risk analysis and investigation for cases in the insider risk management solution. This tab is structured to enable quick review of a case, including a historical timeline of alerts, alerts details, the current risk score for the user in the case, and controls to take effective action to contain the risks in the case.

![Insider risk management user activity](media/insider-risk-temp-user-activities.png)

1. **Date and window time filters**: By default, the last six months of alerts confirmed in the case are displayed in the User activity chart. You can easily filter the chart view with either the slider controls at both ends of the chart window, or by defining specific start and end dates in the chart filter control.
2. **Risk alert activity and details**: Risk activities are visually displayed as colored bubbles in the User activity chart. Bubbles are created for different categories of risk and bubble size is proportional to the number of risk activities for the category. Select a bubble to display the details for each risk activity. Details include:
    - **Date** of the risk activity.
    - The **risk activity category**. For example, *Email(s) with attachments sent outside the organization* or *File(s) downloaded from SharePoint Online*.
    - **Risk score** for the alert. This score is the numerical score for the alert risk severity level.
    - Number of **files** or **emails** associated with the alert. Links to each file or email associated with the risk activity is also available.
3. **Risk activity legend**: Across the bottom of the USer activity chart, a color-coded legend helps you quickly determine risk category for each alert.
4. **Risk activity chronology**: The full chronology of all risk alerts associated with the case are listed, including all the details available in the corresponding alert bubble.
5. **Case actions**: Options for resolving the case are on the case action toolbar. You can resolve a case, send an email notice to the employee, or escalate the case for a data or employee investigation.
6. **Case export**: You can export all alerts and alert details to a CSV for a case.

### Content explorer

The **Content explorer** tab allows risk analysts and investigators to review copies of all individual files and email messages associated with risk alerts. For example, if an alert is created when an employee downloads hundreds of files from SharePoint Online to a USB device and the activity triggers a policy alert, all the downloaded files for the alert are captured and copied into the insider risk management case from original storage sources. For all alerts, copies of data and message files are archived as a snapshot in time of the items, while maintaining the original files and messages in the storage sources. The copying of data and messages is transparent to the employee associated with the alert and to the owner of the content. The permission settings and access rights for the data are maintained for the copied content and messages and risk analysts and investigators need these permissions and rights if they need to open and view the files. Each file and message is automatically assigned a unique file ID in the insider risk management case for management purposes.

![Insider risk management case content explorer](media/insider-risk-temp-content-explorer.png)

To make it easier for risk analysts and investigators to review captured data and messages and review the context to the case, several filtering and sorting tools are included in the Content Explorer. For basic sorting, the **Date** and **File class** columns support sorting using the column titles in the content queue pane. Other queue columns are available to add to the view to provide different pivots on the files and messages.

To add or remove column headings for the content queue, use the **Edit columns** control and select from the following column options:

| **Column option** | **Description** |

### Case notes

The **Case notes** tab in the case is where risk analysts and investigators share comments, feedback, and insights about their work for the case. Notes are permanent additions to a case and cannot be edited or deleted 
after the note is saved. The case notes dashboard displays notes by the user that created the note and the time that has passed since the note was saved. To search the case note text field for a specific keyword, use the **Search** button on the case dashboard and enter a specific keyword.

To add a note to a case:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Cases** tab.
2. Select a case, then select the **Case notes** tab.
3. Select **Add a case note**
4. On the **Add case note** dialog, type your note for the case. Select **Save** to add the note to the case or select **Cancel** close without saving the note to the case.

### Contributors

The **Contributors** tab in the case is where risk analysts and investigators can add other reviewers to the case. Be default, all users assigned the **Insider Risk Management Analysts** and **Insider Risk Management Investigators** roles are listed as contributors for each active and closed case.

All insider risk management cases must be managed with appropriate access controls in place to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the investigation. To help maintain access control of cases, users are assigned one of two types of access to cases:

- **Permanent access**: Permanent access is automatically granted to users with the **Insider Risk Management Analysts** and **Insider Risk Management Investigators** roles when the case is created from an alert. Permanent access grants full control of the case for the lifetime of the case and grants the ability to add other case contributors.
- **Temporary access**: Temporary access is only granted to users by contributors that have permanent access for the case. Typically, this access level is granted to user that needs to add notes to a case. Contributors with temporary access have all case management control except:
    - Permission to confirm or dismiss alerts
    - Permission to edit the contributors for cases
    - Permission to view files and messages in the Content Explorer

To add a contributor to a case:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com), go to **Insider risk management** and select the **Cases** tab.
2. Select a case, then select the **Contributors** tab.
3. Select **Add contributor**
4. On the **Add contributor** dialog, start typing the name of the user you want to add and then select the user from the suggested user list.
5. On the **Add contributor** dialog, select the access level for the contributor. You can select **Permanent** or **Temporary**.
6. Select **Add** to add the user as a contributor or select **Cancel** close without adding the user as a contributor.
