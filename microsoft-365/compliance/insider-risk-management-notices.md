# Insider risk management notices (preview)

Insider risk management notices allow you to send email messages to employees when their activities generate an insider risk policy match and alert. In most cases, employee actions that generate alerts are the result of mistakes or inadvertent activities without ill intent. Notices serve as simple reminders to employees to be more careful or to provide links or information for refresher training or corporate policy resources. Notices can be an important part of your internal compliance training program and can help create a documented audit trail for employees with recurring risk activities.

You can create notice templates if you want to send users an email reminder notice for policy matches as part of the issue resolution process. Notices can only be sent to the employee email address associated with the policy match that generated the specific alert for remediation. When selecting a notice template to apply to a policy violation as part of the remediation workflow, you can choose to accept the field values defined in the template or overwrite the fields as needed.

## Notice dashboard

The Notices dashboard displays a list of configured notice templates and allows you to create new notice templates. The notice templates are listed in reverse date order with the most recent notice template listed first.

## HTML for notices

If you'd like to create more than a simple text-based email message for notifications, you can create a more detailed message by using HTML in the message body field of a notice template. The following example provides the message body format for a basic HTML-based email notification template:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>Action Required: Contoso Employee Code of Conduct Policy Training</h2>
<p>A recent activity you've performed has generated a risk alert for the Contoso Employee <a href='https://www.contoso.com'>Code of Conduct Policy</a>.</p>
<p>You are required to attend the Contoso Employee Code of Conduct <a href='https://www.contoso.com'>training</a> within the next 14 days. Please contact <a href='mailto:hr@contoso.com'>Human Resources</a> with any questions about this training request.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><em>Human Resources</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

> [!NOTE]
> HTML href attribute implementation in the insider risk management notice templates currently support only single quotation marks instead of double quotation marks for URL references.
