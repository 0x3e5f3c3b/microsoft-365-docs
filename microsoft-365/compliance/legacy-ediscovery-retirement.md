# Legacy eDiscovery tools being retired

We're retiring two legacy eDiscovery tools in the first half of 2020: Advanced eDiscovery v1.0 and In-Place eDiscovery and Holds.

Advanced eDiscovery v1 (also called Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery) is the version of Advanced eDiscovery that is accessed by clicking "Switch to Advanced eDiscovery" in an eDiscovery case in the Security & Compliance Center.  The retirement of Advance eDiscovery v1.0 doesn't affect the latest version of Advanced eDiscovery (also called Advanced eDiscovery v2 or Advanced eDiscovery in Microsoft 365), which is accessed on the eDiscovery > Advanced eDiscovery page in the Security & Compliance Center.

The In-Place eDiscovery and Holds tool in the Exchange admin center is also being retired. This tool is used for searching, holding, and exporting mailbox content in Exchange Online. Similar functionality is available in the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

More information about retiring these legacy eDiscovery tools is coming soon.
