# Manage information governance

 Manage your content lifecycle using Microsoft 365 features to import, store, and classify business-critical data so you can keep what you need and delete what you don't.




|**Capability**|**More information**|
|:-----|:-----|
| **Manage data** | Use [retention polices and retention labels](retention.md) to keep the data that you need to retain and delete what you don't need to keep or must delete for regulatory or compliance reasons.<br /><br /> Use the [import service](importing-pst-files-to-office-365.md) to quickly bulk-import PST files to Exchange Online mailboxes in your organization and configure [unlimited archiving](unlimited-archiving.md) to provide users with additional mailbox storage space.|
| **Monitor data** | [Verify retention labels](view-label-activity-for-documents.md) are correctly applied to content in your organization and use [label analytics](label-analytics.md) to quickly see where these labels are used most and where they are being applied.|
| **Manage inactive mailboxes** | Your organization might need to retain former employees' email after they leave the organization. Depending on your organization's retention requirements, you might need to retain mailbox content for a few months or years after employment ends, or you might need to retain mailbox content indefinitely. Regardless of how long you need to retain email, you can create [inactive mailboxes](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md) to retain the mailbox of former employees.|
| **Records management** | Ensure [core business records](records-management.md) are correctly declared and stored with full audit visibility to meet regulatory requirements.|
