# Microsoft Application and Protection Governance in Microsoft 365srsr

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*
 
Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) is a solution for Microsoft 365 applications that provides you with comprehensive: 

- **Insights**: See a view of all of your Microsoft 365 applications in your tenant in a single dashboard. You can see all the applications’ activities and react or respond to them.
- **Governance**: Create proactive or reactive policies for application and user patterns and behaviors and protect your users from using non-compliant or malicious apps and limiting access to data through risky apps.
- **Detection**: Be alerted and notified when there are anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used. 
- **Remediation**: Along with automatic remediation capabilities, use remediation tools and controls in a timely manner to respond to anomalous app activity detections.

Unlike other application governance products in the marketplace, MAPG is a platform-based solution that is an integral part of the Microsoft 365 app ecosystem. Today, Microsoft allows developers to build cloud applications using Azure AD, Microsoft’s cloud identity platform, and other resources and access to tenant data through the Microsoft Graph. With MAPG, developers can build high-quality productivity apps that are secure and compliant.

With MAPG, Microsoft 365 provides a comprehensive level of protection from malicious actors that use apps to access your tenant data:

- App access and restrictions based on user and device identity

  With Azure AD and Intune, you can configure identity and device access policies to enforce secure sign-ins and to allow and restrict app access. With Azure AD Identity Protection, you can monitor user and device access and respond to anomalous behavior.

- User activity within apps

  With Microsoft Cloud App Security, you can monitor user activity and respond to anomalous behavior.

- App activity within a Microsoft 365 tenant
 
  With MAPG, you can monitor what apps are doing and respond to anomalous behavior.
