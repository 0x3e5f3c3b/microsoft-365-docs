# Microsoft Application and Protection Governance in Microsoft 365 (in preview)

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) is a solution for Microsoft 365 applications that provides you with comprehensive: 

- **Insights**: See a view of all of your Microsoft 365 applications in your tenant in a single dashboard. You can see all the applications’ activities and react or respond to them.
- **Governance**: Create proactive or reactive policies for application and user patterns and behaviors and protect your users from using non-compliant or malicious apps and limiting access to data through risky apps.
- **Detection**: Be alerted and notified when there are anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used. 
- **Remediation**: Along with automatic remediation capabilities, use remediation tools and controls in a timely manner to respond to anomalous app activity detections.

Unlike other application governance products in the marketplace, MAPG is a platform-based solution that is an integral part of the Microsoft 365 app ecosystem. Today, Microsoft allows developers to build cloud applications using Azure AD, Microsoft’s cloud identity platform, and other resources and access to tenant data through the Microsoft Graph. With MAPG, developers can build high-quality productivity apps that are secure and compliant.

## Using MAPG

Using MAPG to protect your tenant and its data from potentially malicious or ill-behaved apps falls into these three areas:

| Area | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| App visibility and insights (add link to first article in **Visibility and insights** node) | Get a 360° view on traffic and activity of the Microsoft 365 applications in your tenant. |
| App policies for reinforced governance (add link to first article in **App policies** node) | Create proactive or reactive app policies, which will allow you to enforce governance for your Microsoft 3635 apps. |
| Detection and remediation (add link to first article in **Detection and remediation** node) | Based on the alerts generated through the settings on your app policies, monitor your apps for anomalous app behavior and remediate them, either automatically based on app policy settings or manually. |
