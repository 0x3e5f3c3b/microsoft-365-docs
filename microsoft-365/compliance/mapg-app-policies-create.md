# Create app policies

Along with a built-in set of capabilities to detect anomalous app behavior and generate alerts, app policies in Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) are a way for you to create additional methods to:

- Specify additional conditions by which MAPG can alert you to app behavior for automatic or manual mitigation.
- Implement the app compliance policies for your organization.

You can create app policies from provided templates that can be customized or you can create a custom app policy.

To create a new app policy, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Overview page > Policies > Create New**.

## App policy templates

To create a new app policy based on an app policy template, on the **Choose App policy template page**, select a category of app template, the name of the template, and then click **Next**.

MAPG has three categories of app policy templates.

### App usage

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app usage.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Unused apps | Identifies unused apps in your tenant to help reduce risk from unused and stale apps. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are marked as unused and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| Increase in app users | Highlights apps with recently increased users to identify apps with that have recently gained a larger footprint in your tenant and may need further investigation. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that have had a more than a 50% increase in use in the last 7 days and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| New app with high volume data access | This policy will highlight any recently registered apps with high volume data access to ensure those data patterns are expected. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that have been registered in the last 7 days and have had more than 1 GB in data access over that period. This policy can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
|||

### App Permissions

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app permissions.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Overpermissioned apps | Highlights any apps with more granted permissions than are being used by those apps to identify opportunities for potential permission reduction. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are marked as overpermissioned and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| New app with high-privilege permissions | Highlights all new apps with high privilege permissions to identify potential high-footprint apps that may need further investigation. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps registered within the last 7 days that have high-scoped permissions. |
| New app with app-only permissions | Highlights all new apps with permissions to access data across the tenant, which are potentially a higher risk set of permissions. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps registered within the last 7 days that have app-only permissions. |
|||

### App certification

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app certification.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| App certification loss | Highlights all previously certified apps that recently lost their app certification, which allows you to ensure that this status change is expected. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are uncertified and have had their app certification changed in the last 7 days. |
| New uncertified app | Highlights new apps that have not been through the app certification process to ensure that they are expected in the tenant. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that were registered in the last 7 days and are uncertified. |
|||

## Custom app policies

Use a custom app policy when you need to do something not already done by one of the built-in templates

To create a new app policy based on an app policy template, on the **Choose App policy template page**, select the **Custom** category, the **Custom policy** template, and then click **Next**.


On the **Name and description** page, configure the following:

- Policy Name

- Policy Description

- Choose Policy severity (tied to alert?)

  - High
  - Medium
  - Low

On the **Choose Policy settings and conditions** page, configure the following:

For Choose which apps this policy is applicable for, select:

- All Apps
- Choose specific apps

  A pane allows you to select one or more apps.
  Click **Add**.

Click **Next**.

On the **Choose Policy settings and conditions** page, select **Set new conditions for policy**, and then click **Next**.

The **Create rule** pane allows you to select conditions for a new rule. Click **Add condition** and select from the list of conditions, and then specify the value of the condition. You can add multiple conditions.

Here are the available conditions for a custom app policy.

|Condition | Condition values accepted | More information |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| App registration age | Within last X days |  |
| App certification | Yes or No | What is Microsoft 365 Certification |
| App certification changed | Yes or No |  |
| Publisher verification | Yes or No | What is Publisher Verification? |
| Permission granted | Select one or more API permission from list | Microsoft Graph permissions reference |
| Has high scoped permission | Yes or No | This is an internal designation based on the same logic used by MCAS. |
| Overprivileged app | Yes or No | Apps with more granted permissions than are being used by those apps. |
| Unused App | Yes or No | Apps with no API activity in last 90 days. |
| Last used | Within last X days |  |
| App data access | Greater than X GB data access per hour |  |
| App data access trend | X% increase in data usage in last 7 days |  |
| App API Access | Greater than X API calls per hour |  |
| App API Access trend | X% increase in API Calls in last 7 days	 |  |
| Users consented | (Greater than or Less than) X consented users |  |
| Users consented trend | X% increase in last 90 days |  |
| HVE user consented | Yes or No | A High Value Entity (HVE) user is one that is tagged as a priority account. |
| Delegating user | Select user(s) from list |  |
| Delegating userâ€™s role | Select one or more: Teams Administrator, Directory Readers, Security Reader, Compliance Administrator, Security Administrator, Helpdesk Administrator, SharePoint Administrator, Exchange Administrator, Global Reader, Global Administrator, Compliance Data Administrator, User Administrator, Service Support Administrator	| Multiple selections allowed. <br><br> Any Azure AD role with assigned member should be made available in this list. |
| Workload accessed | OneDrive and/or SharePoint and/or Exchange | Multiple selections allowed. |
| Error rate | Error rate is greater than X% |  |
||||

All of the specified conditions must be met for this app policy to apply.

When you are done specifying the conditions, select **Save**, and then select **Next**.

On the **Define Policy Actions** page, select **Disable app** if you want MAPG to disable the app when an alert based on this policy is generated, and then click **Next**.

On the **Define Policy Status** page, select one of these options:

- **Audit mode**: Policies will be evaluated but the configured actions will not occur. Audit mode policies appear as "Test" in the list of policies.
- **Active**: Policies will be evaluated and configured actions will occur.
- **Inactive**: Policies will not be evaluated and the configured actions will not occur.

## Configure a user-based policy

## Ceate an app metadata-based policy

Publish metadata-based policies

## Configure access permissions
--> 

## Test and monitor your new app policy

Now that your app policy is created, you should monitor it in the **Policies** page to ensure it is registering an expected number of active alerts and total alerts during testing. 

\[Placeholder: Screenshot of Policies page with policy and alerts info highlighted]

If the number of alerts is an unexpectedly low value, edit the settings of the app policy to ensure you've configured it correctly before setting its status.

Here is an example of a process for creating a new policy, testing it, and then making it active:

1. Create the new policy with severity, apps, conditions, and actions set to initial values, and status set to audit mode.
2. Check for expected behavior, such as alerts generated.
3. If the behavior is not expected, edit the policy apps, conditions, and action settings as needed and go back to step 2.
4. If the behavior is expected, edit the policy and change its status to active.
