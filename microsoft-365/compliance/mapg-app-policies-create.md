You can create app policies from built-in templates that can be customized or you can create a custom app policy.

To create a new app policy, go to **M365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Overview page > Policies > Create New**. From here, you can create a new app policy based on a set of policy templates or a custom app policy.

## App policy templates

To create a new app policy based on an app policy template, on the **Choose App policy template page**, select a category or app template, the name of the template, and then click **Next**.

MAPG has three categories of built-in app policy templates.

### App usage

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app usage.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Unused apps | Identifies unused apps in your tenant to help reduce risk from unused and stale apps. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are marked as unused and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| Increase in app users | Highlights apps with recently increased users to identify apps with that have recently gained a larger footprint in your tenant and may need further investigation. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that have had a more than a 50% increase in use in the last 7 days and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| New app with high volume data access | This policy will highlight any recently registered apps with high volume data access to ensure those data patterns are expected. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that have been registered in the last 7 days and have had more than 1 GB in data access over that period. This policy can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
|||

### App Permissions

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app permissions.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Overpermissioned apps | Highlights any apps with more granted permissions than are being used by those apps to identify opportunities for potential permission reduction. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are marked as overpermissioned and can be customized with additional conditions and actions. |
| New app with high-privilege permissions | Highlights all new apps with high privilege permissions to identify potential high-footprint apps that may need further investigation. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps registered within the last 7 days that have high-scoped permissions. |
| New app with app-only permissions | Highlights all new apps with permissions to access data across the tenant, which are potentially a higher risk set of permissions. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps registered within the last 7 days that have app-only permissions. |
|||

### App certification

MAPG includes these templates to generate alerts for app certification.

| Template name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| App certification loss | Highlights all previously certified apps that recently lost their app certification, which allows you to ensure that this status change is expected. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that are uncertified and have had their app certification changed in the last 7 days. |
| New uncertified app | Highlights new apps that have not been through the app certification process to ensure that they are expected in the tenant. <br><br> By default, this policy will flag all apps that were registered in the last 7 days and are uncertified. |
|||
