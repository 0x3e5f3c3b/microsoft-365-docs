Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) can detect anomalous app behavior in your Microsoft 365 tenant and generate alerts that you can see, investigate, and resolve. Beyond this built-in detection capability, you can use a set of default app policies and create your own that generate additional alerts.

These proactive or reactive policies for app and user patterns and behaviors can protect your users from using non-compliant or malicious apps and limit the access of risky apps to your tenant data.

Here's a quick review of required administrator roles for app policy management.

| Role | Read policies | Create, update, or delete policies |

How app policies are the method by which MAPG detects app anomolies resulting in detection (alerts) and remediation (manual or automatic) 


CFA #2 Scenario 1: As an admin, I can quickly set up policies to govern M365 apps in my tenant using MAPG out-of-the-box templates
CFA #2 Scenario 2: As an admin, I can create customized policies to govern M365 apps in my tenant to meet my organizations requirements.
CFA #2 Scenario 3: As an admin or policy reviewer, I can view all policies created in my environment and quickly see which policies have associated alerts. 
CFA #2 Scenario 4: As an admin, I can adjust policies efficiently to meet changing needs.
