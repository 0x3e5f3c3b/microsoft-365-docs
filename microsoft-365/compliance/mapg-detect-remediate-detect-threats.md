# Remediate app threats

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

You remediate app threats to your Microsoft 365 tenant through the **Alerts** page of the Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) section of the Microsoft 365 Compliance center.

The **Alerts** page by default lists new alerts generated by MAPG and through app policies. You can view the details of a specific alert by selecting it, which opens an alert pane with additional information and the ability to change its status.

From this pane, you can get additional information from the **Description** field.

Remediation of an app alert can take place in stages:

1. Investigation: Examine the information in the alert and change its status to **Mark in Progress**.
2. Resolution: After your investigation and, as needed, the determination of app or app policy changes, you change its status to **Resolved**.

Based on app alert patterns, you can update the appropriate app policy and change its **Action** setting to perform automatic remediation, removing your need to investigate and manually resolve the alert. See [Manage your app policies](mapg-app-policies-manage.md) for more information.
