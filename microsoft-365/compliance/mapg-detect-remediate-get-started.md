# Get started with app threat detection and remediation

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) collects threat alerts that are generated by built-in MAPG detection methods based on malicious app activities and policy-based alerts generated by active app policies that you create. 

The first place to view app alerts is the Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) dashboard at [https://compliance.microsoft.com/m365appprotection](https://compliance.microsoft.com/m365appprotection).

![The MAPG overview page in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center with the Detection and policy alerts section highlighted](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-overview-alerts.png)

On this overview page, the **Detection and policy alerts** section lists the latest alerts. You can use this to quickly see the current app alert activity for your tenant. Threat alerts have a Tag value starting with **MAPG** and policy-based alerts have a Tag value of **Policy**.

To see all of the alerts, select the **Alerts** tab.

## Whatâ€™s available on the Alerts page

The **Alerts** page lists all of the MAPG-based alerts for your tenant.

Each listed alert has the following information:

- **Alert name**: The type of anomalous behavior.
- **App name**: The app that generated the alert.
- **Severity**: The severity assigned by MAPG for alerts it creates or the severity of the app policy that generated the alert.
- **Source**: Threat alerts have a Tag value starting with **MAPG** and policy-based alerts have a Tag value of **Policy**.
- **Status**: **New** indicates an alert that has not been assigned a status. Once assigned, the status is either **In progress** while being investigated or **Resolved** for alerts that have been addressed through automatic or manual remediation.
- **Date created**: The date the alert was generated by either MAPG detection or through an app policy.
- **Last activity**: The date the status of the alert was last changed.

The alert list is sorted by **Date created** by default. To sort the list by another category, select the category name.

You can also export the current alert list to a comma separated value (CSV) file. For example, you could open the CVS file in Microsoft Excel and sort the list of alerts by **Severity** and then **Date Created**.
