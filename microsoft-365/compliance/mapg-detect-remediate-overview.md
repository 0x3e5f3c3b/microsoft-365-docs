Review of required administrator roles for visibility and insights

With MAPG detection, be alerted and notified when there are anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used. 

With MAPG remediation, along with automatic remediation capabilities, use remediation tools and controls in a timely manner to respond to anomalous app activity detections.


**Feedback from Anand:** We should add some details on how MAPG works with M365 Defender (previously MTP). Also, we should highlight the integration with MCAS and AAD.
