# Learn about app threat detection and remediation

With Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG), you can:

- Easily monitor the alerts that are being generated by built-in MAPG detection methods and by active app policies that you create. These alerts can indicate anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used.  You can also use patterns in alerts to create new app policies or modify the settings of existing policies for more restrictive actions.

- Easily remediate alerts either manually after investigation or automatically through the action settings on active app policies.


**Feedback from Anand:** We should add some details on how MAPG works with M365 Defender (previously MTP). Also, we should highlight the integration with MCAS and AAD.

>[!Note]
>Anomalous activities from Azure-only apps that are not granted permissions to access Microsoft 365 resources are not included in MAPG detection and alerting.

Here's a quick review of required administrator roles for alerts and remediation.
