With Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG), you can quickly gain visibility into and  meaningful insights on your Microsoft 365 application ecosystem. You start from the MAPG dashboard that provides a high-level summary of the apps in your tenant and from there you can efficiently navigate to top tasks.

With MAPG visibility and insights, you can see 

- A view of all the Microsoft 365 apps in your tenant in a single dashboard. 
- All the appsâ€™ activities so that you can react or respond to them.

>[!Note]
>Azure-only apps that are not granted permissions to access Microsoft 365 resources are not displayed in MAPG.

Review of required administrator roles for visibility and insights

With MAPG detection, be alerted and notified when there are anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used. 

With MAPG remediation, along with automatic remediation capabilities, use remediation tools and controls in a timely manner to respond to anomalous app activity detections.


**Feedback from Anand:** We should add some details on how MAPG works with M365 Defender (previously MTP). Also, we should highlight the integration with MCAS and AAD.
