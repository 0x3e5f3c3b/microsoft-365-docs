# Learn about app threat detection and remediation

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

With Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG), you can:

- Easily monitor the threat alerts that are being generated by built-in MAPG detection methods and based on malicious app activities and policy-based alerts generated by active app policies that you create. These alerts can indicate anomalies in app activity and when non-compliant, malicious, or risky apps are used.  You can also use patterns in alerts to create new app policies or modify the settings of existing policies for more restrictive actions.

- Easily remediate alerts either manually after investigation or automatically through the action settings on active app policies.


>[!Note]
>Anomalous activities from Azure-only apps that are not granted permissions to access Microsoft 365 resources are not included in MAPG detection and alerting.

Here's a quick review of required administrator roles for alerts and remediation.

## MAPG integration with Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Cloud App Security

MAPG, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Microsoft Cloud App Security collect and provide different data sets:

- Azure AD provides foundational app metadata and detailed information on sign-ins to apps.
- MAPG provides detailed information about an appâ€™s activity at the API level.
- Microsoft Cloud App Security provides app risk information.

By sharing information across MAPG, Azure AD, and Microsoft Cloud App Security, you can display aggregate information in one portal and easily link to another portal for more information. Here are some examples:

- App sign-in information in MAPG: 

  From the MAPG portal, you can see the aggregated sign-in activity for each app and link back to the Azure Active Directory admin center for the details of sign-in events. 

- App API usage information in the Azure Active Directory admin center: 

  From the Azure Active Directory admin center, you can see the aggregated app usage information and link to the MAPG portal for the details of app usage.

- API usage information in the Microsoft Cloud App Security portal: 

  From the Microsoft Cloud App Security portal, you can see API usage level and aggregate data transfer and link to the MAPG portal for the details.

Additionally, MAPG sends its alerts as signals to Microsoft Cloud App Security and Microsoft 365 Defender for more detailed analysis of app-based security incidents.
