# Get started with visibility and insights

The first place to get started is the Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) dashboard at [https://compliance.microsoft.com/m365appprotection](https://compliance.microsoft.com/m365appprotection).

\[Placeholder for MAPG Overview page screenshot]

Alternatively, you can access the MAPG dashboard from **Microsoft 365 admin center > Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Overview page**.

## Whatâ€™s available in the dashboard

The dashboard contains a summary of the components of the Microsoft 365 app ecosystem in the tenant:

- **Tenant Summary**: The count of key app categories.
- **Security and compliance alerts**: All active alerts in the tenant
- **Data and resource access**: Aggregate API app usage and overall usage of top resources in the tenant.
- **Improve your app protection and governance**: Recommended actions such as policy creation and a shortcut to view apps in Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS).
- **Top apps by categories**: The top apps in key app categories, which you can sort by:
  
  - **All categories**: Sorts across all available categories.
  - **High privilege**: High privilege is an internally determined category based on platform ML and signals.
  - **Overpermissioned**: When MAPG receives telemetry that indicates that a permission granted to an application is not being used in the last 90 days, that application is overpermissioned. MAPG must be operating for at least 90 days to determine if any app is overpermissioned.  
  - **Unverified**: Applications that have not received[ Microsoft 365 certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-app-certification/overview#microsoft-365-certification) are considered unverified.
  - **App only**: [Application permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types) are used by apps that can run without a signed-in user present. Apps with permissions to access data across the tenant are potentially a higher risk.
  - **New apps**: New Microsoft 365 apps that have been registered in the last 7 days.
