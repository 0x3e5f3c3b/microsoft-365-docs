With MAPG, you can quickly gain visibility into and  meaningful insights on your Microsoft 365 application ecosystem. You start from the MAPG dashboard that provides a high-level summary of the apps in your tenant and from there you can efficiently navigate to top tasks.

With MAPG visibility and insights, you can see 

- A view of all the Microsoft 365 apps in your tenant in a single dashboard. 
- All the appsâ€™ activities so that you can react or respond to them.

>[!Note]
>Azure-only apps that are not granted permissions to access Microsoft 365 resources are not displayed in MAPG.

Here's a quick review of required administrator roles for visibility and insights.
