Overview of visibility and insights capabilities and value

With MAPG insights, you can see 

- A view of all the Microsoft 365 apps in your tenant in a single dashboard. 
- All the apps’ activities and react or respond to them.

You can quickly gain meaningful insights on your Microsoft 365 application ecosystem and efficiently navigate to top tasks.
