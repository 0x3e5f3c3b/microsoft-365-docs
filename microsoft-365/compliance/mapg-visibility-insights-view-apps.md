Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) allows you to quickly gain deep insights on the M365 apps in your tenant.

- You can see a list of all OAuth-enabled M365 apps in the tenant, together with relevant app metadata and usage data. 
- You can see app details with deeper insights and information by clicking an app in the list.

## Getting a list of all the apps in your tenant

For a summary of apps in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > All apps**.

\[Placeholder for MAPG All apps page screenshot]

You will see a list of apps and this information:

- App Name
- Publisher
- App Certification

  Indicates whether the app is compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft.

- Last Modified
- Date Installed
- Permission Privilege
- Number of Users
- Data Access: The sum of the appâ€™s data upload and download in the tenant over the last day, along with the change over the prior day.

You can also search by app name with a search box of the **All Apps** page.

## Getting detailed information on an app

For detailed information on a specific app in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > All apps page > *app name***.

The app details pane provides additional information in these tabs:

| Tab name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Details | See additional data on the app such as the date first consented and the App ID. |
| Usage | See the data accessed by the app in the tenant, plot the data usage, and filter by High Value Entity (HVE) users to show usage by [priority accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts). |
| Users | See a list of users who are using the app, whether they are a priority account, and the amount of data downloaded and uploaded. |
| Permissions | See a summary of the permissions granted to and used by the app, the list of specific permissions, and their status and usage level. |

There is also a **Disable App** control to disable the use of the selected app, but requires these roles:

- Compliance Administrator
- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator
