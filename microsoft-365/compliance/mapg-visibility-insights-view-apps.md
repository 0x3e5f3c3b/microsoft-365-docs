### Getting a list of all the apps in your tenant

For a summary of apps in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > All apps**.

You will see a list of apps and this information:

- App Name
- Publisher
- App Certification: Whether the app is compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft.
- Last Modified
- Date Installed
- Permission Privilege
- Number of Users
- Data Access: The sum of the appâ€™s data upload and download in the tenant over the last day, along with the change over the prior day.

You can also search by app name with a search box in the upper right of the **All Apps** page.

### Getting detailed information on an app

For detailed information on a specific app in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > All apps page > *app name***.

The app details pane provides additional information in these tabs:

- Details
- Usage 
- Users 
- Permissions

On the **Details** tab, see additional data on the app such as the date first consented and the App ID.

There is also a **Disable App** control to disable the use of the selected app, but requires these roles:

- Compliance Administrator
- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator

On the **Usage** tab, you can see the data accessed by the app in the tenant, plot the data usage, and filter by High Value Entity (HVE) usersto show usage by accounts designated a priority account.

On the **Users** tab, a list of users who are using the app, whether they are a [priority user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts?view=o365-worldwide), and the amount of data downloaded and uploaded.

On the **Permissions** tab, see a summary of the permissions granted to and used by the app, the list of specific permissions and their status and usage level.
