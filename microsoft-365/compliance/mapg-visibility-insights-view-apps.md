# View your apps

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Microsoft Application Protection and Governance (MAPG) allows you to quickly gain deep insights into the Microsoft 365 apps in your tenant. For example, you can see:

- A list of all OAuth-enabled Microsoft 365 apps in the tenant, together with relevant app metadata and usage data. 
- App details with deeper insights and information by selecting an app in the list.

## Getting a list of all the apps in your tenant

For a summary of apps in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Apps**.

![The MAPG app summary page in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-apps.png)

You will see a list of apps and this information:

- App Name
- Publisher
- App Certification

  Indicates whether the app is compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft.

- Last Modified
- Date Installed
- Permission Privilege
- Number of Users
- Data Access

  The sum of the appâ€™s data upload and download in the tenant over the last day, along with the change over the prior day.

The app list is sorted by **Last Modified** by default. To sort the list by another category, select the category name.

You can also select **Search** to search for an app by name.

## Getting detailed information on an app

For detailed information on a specific app in your tenant, go to **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center > App protection & governance > Apps page > *app name***.

![The MAPG app details pane in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center](..\media\manage-app-protection-governance\mapg-cc-apps-app.png)

The app details pane provides additional information on these tabs:

| Tab name | Description |
|:-------|:-----|
| Details | See additional data on the app such as the date first consented and the App ID. |
| Usage | See the data accessed by the app in the tenant, plot the data usage, and filter by High Value Entity (HVE) users to show usage by [priority accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts). |
| Users | See a list of users who are using the app, whether they are a priority account, and the amount of data downloaded and uploaded. |
| Permissions | See a summary of the permissions granted to and used by the app, the list of specific permissions, and their status and usage level. |
|||

There is also a **Disable App** control to disable the use of the selected app, but requires these [administrator roles](manage-app-protection-governance.md#administrator-roles):

- Compliance Administrator
- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator
