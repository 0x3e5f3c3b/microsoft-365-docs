The welcome banner gives you some pointers on how to get started, with next steps, and an invitation for you to give us feedback.

## Card section

When you first visit the Microsoft 365 compliance center, the card section on the home page shows you at a glance how your organization is doing with data compliance, what solutions are available for your organization, and a summary of any active alerts.

From here, you can:

- Select the **Microsoft Compliance Score** card, which leads you to the new [Compliance Score](compliance-score.md) solution. It calculates a risk-based score that measures your progress toward completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It also provides workflow capabilities and built-in control mapping to help you efficiently carry out those actions.

    ![Compliance Score card Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-compliance-score-card.png)

- Select the new **Solution catalog** card, which links to collections of [integrated solutions](microsoft-365-solution-catalog.md) you can use to help you manage end-to-end compliance scenarios. A solution's capabilities and tools might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

    ![Solution catalog card Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-solution-catalog-card.png)

- Select the **Active alerts** card, which includes a summary of the most [active alerts]((../security/office-365-security/alerts.md)) and includes a link where you can view more detailed information, such as Severity, Status, Category, and more.

    ![Active alerts card Microsoft 365 compliance center](media/m365-compliance-center-active-alerts-card.png)

You'll also add many additional cards, such as one showing your organization's cloud app compliance, and another showing data about users with shared files, with links to [Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/) or other tools where you can explore data.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why am I taken to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to complete some tasks, such as defining certain policies?**

We're still developing the Microsoft 365 compliance center, and we'll be adding more functionality and solutions over the coming months. In the meantime, there are some tasks that must be completed in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). In those cases, you'll be directed automatically to the location where you can complete the task at hand, such as creating or editing a supervision policy.

**Why don't I see the new Microsoft 365 compliance center yet?**

First, make sure that you have the appropriate [licenses and permissions](../security/office-365-security/microsoft-security-and-compliance.md#required-licenses-and-permissions). Then, sign in at [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com). If you don't see the new compliance center yet, you'll have it soon.

**Some of my compliance features aren't available in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. What do I do?**

We're still adding functionality to the Microsoft 365 compliance center. If you can't find something, such as audit log search, use the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com)). Your configurations are saved in both the existing Office 365 Security & Compliance Center and in the new Microsoft 365 compliance center automatically.

To go there, in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, in the navigation pane on the left side of the screen, choose **More resources**, and then, under **Office 365 security & compliance center**, choose **Open**.
