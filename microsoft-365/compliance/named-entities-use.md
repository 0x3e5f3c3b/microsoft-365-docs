# Use named entities in your data loss prevention policies

Read through [Learn about named entities](named-entities-learn.md) before you start to use them.

## Before you begin

### SKU/subscriptions licensing

For full licensing details see, [the service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection-data-classification-analytics-overview-content--activity-explorer).

### Permissions

The account you use to create and edit data loss prevention (DLP) policies, must have the **DLP Compliance Management** role permissions. For more information, see [Give users access to the Office 365 Compliance Center](../security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center.md)


## Supported locations

You can use named entity SITs and enhanced policies to detect and protect sensitive items in these locations:

- SharePoint sites
- OneDrive accounts
- Teams chat and channel messages
- Devices (Windows 10, and 11 endpoint devices)
- Exchange mailboxes

Named entity SITs and enhanced policies are not supported for:


- On-premises repositories
- Power BI

## Create and edit enhanced policies

To create or edit a DLP policy, use the procedures in [Create, test, and tune a DLP policy](create-test-tune-dlp-policy.md).

## Workloads and services that support named entities


- **Microsoft 365 eDiscovery** supports the use of named entities in Substrate services.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** supports the use of named entities in Defender for Cloud Apps policies.
- **Insider Risk Management** supports the use of named entities in Substrate services.
<!--- **Communication Compliance** doesn't support the use of named entities in Exchange transport rules and data-at-rest.
- **Microsoft Information Governance** (MIG) doesn't support the use of named entities in Exchange transport rules and data-at-rest.-->

## Best practices for using named entity SITs

Here are some practices you can use when you create or edit a policy that uses a named entity SIT.

- When you're looking for data that's in a spreadsheet and the keyword is only in the column header, use low instance counts, like three to five instances. For example, let's say you're looking for US Social Security numbers, and the keyword `Social Security Number` only occurs in the column header. Since the values (the corroborative evidence) is in the cells below, it's likely that only the first few instances would be in close enough proximity to the keyword to be detected.  

- If you are using a named entity SIT, like All Full Names, to help find US Social Security numbers, use larger instance counts such as 10 or 50. Then when both the person names and the SSNs are detected together, you're more likely to get getting true positives.

-     Auto-labeling simulations can be leveraged to further fine tune accuracy by adjusting the instance counts and confidence levels defined in your custom policies or the enhanced template conditions across simulations, before enabling in production a DLP or auto-labeling policy containing named entities.

1)	Identify the SIT or combination of SITs you want to test in simulation mode, either custom or cloned and edited.
2)	Identify or create a sensitivity label to be applied when the auto-labeling policy finds a match in Exchange, SharePoint sites, or OneDrive accounts.
3)	Create an sensitivity auto-labeling policy that uses the SIT from step 1 and with same Conditions and Exceptions that will be used in your DLP policy
4)	Run the policy simulation
5)	View the results
6)	Tune the SIT and the instance count and confidence levels to reduce false positives.
