Russian Personal Data Localization Requirements – Learn More

As of September 1st, 2015, organizations, that are considered personal data operators, must ensure when collecting personal data, that Russian citizens’ personal data recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification (updating, changing) and extraction are performed through the databases located in Russia (“personal data localization requirements”)\[1\].

Microsoft Online Services, available to the organizations (including but not limited to educational institutions) (hereinafter referred to as “customers”), including those enabling personal data processing, – such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform – are provided from data processing centers, located outside of Russia (for more information visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center)).

Based on the type and content of information, processed by customer information systems, such systems, including those using Microsoft cloud products, may be deemed a personal data information system (“PDIS”, “ISPD”). In cases where the customer would like to use Microsoft Online Services, in a system, that qualifies as PDIS through its architecture and types of information processed, Microsoft invites its customers to consider amongst other things available solutions, specified below. All the scenarios provided below are available for customers as an additional option to standard business offerings.

It should be noted, that it is the customer, as personal data operator of PDIS, who is in charge of compliance and shall analyze and assess applicable legal requirements for personal data localization and, at its own discretion, independently determine sufficient measures to ensure, that personal data processing in PDIS complies with the Russian personal data law\[2\].

Subscribing to Microsoft Online Services

Microsoft ID Management

Microsoft invites customers to consider subscribing to Microsoft Online Services – Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform – via a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner. A list of CSP partners is available [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://pinpoint.microsoft.com/ru-RU/search?type=services&campaign=691).

Managing User Identity and Access for Microsoft Online Services

For Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform user verification and access management are performed through [<span class="underline">Azure Active Directory (AAD)</span>](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). Please note that in cases where a Microsoft customer uses a local identification management system for Microsoft cloud services (such as the Windows Server Active Directory (AD) or any other ID management system), the customer has an opportunity to swiftly integrate such system with the Azure Active Directory (AAD) through Azure AD Connect. Detailed information on the Azure AD Connect option is provided [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/azure/active-directory/cloud-provisioning/). Microsoft customers may also consider using applications and solutions of third-party vendors for managing their users and integrate their local identification system with the AAD.
