# Predictive coding module for Advanced eDiscovery (preview)

Using the new predictive coding module in Advanced eDiscovery, you can create and build a model to prioritize review of documents starting with the most relevant documents. To get started, you can create a model, label as few as 50 documents, and then filter documents by model prediction scores to review relevant non-relevant documents.

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the workflow:

1. Open the predictive coding module in a review set.

   ![Click the Analyze dropdown list in a review to go to the Predictive coding module](..\media\PredictiveCoding1.png)

2. On the **Predictive coding models** page, click **New model** to create a new predictive coding model.

3. Label at least 50 documents as **Relevant** or **Not relevant**.

4. Apply the prediction score filter for your model.

5. Monitor the performance, status, and stability of your model.
