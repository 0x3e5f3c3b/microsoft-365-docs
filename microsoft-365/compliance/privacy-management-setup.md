# Get started with privacy management (preview)

In this article: learn how to set up **access to privacy management** for your organization, how to **get started** with evaluating your data, and how to handle important **settings**.

## Sign up

Privacy management will be available within the Microsoft 365 compliance center. The public preview of privacy management is available to organizations with E1, E3, and E5 Office 365 and Microsoft 365 enterprise licenses (free of cost during public preview). Upon general availability of privacy management, organizations with E1, E3, and E5 Office 365 and Microsoft 365 enterprise licenses will need to purchase privacy management licenses to access and use the solution.

Note that the public preview of privacy management will not be available to US Government Community (GCC) Moderate, GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) customers.

To get started with the public preview, obtain the preview subscription from the admin center. If you do not yet have the license when you first select privacy management in the compliance center, you will be directed to the admin center to get started. We recommend the global admin sign in and set user permissions as outlined below when visiting privacy management for the first time. If you don’t hold the required role to obtain the subscription or consent to the terms of using privacy management, you’ll be prompted to contact your global admin for assistance.

Confirming that you would like to start using privacy management signals that you agree to the terms and the personal data evaluation process. You can review the provided links in full before proceeding.

## Set user permissions and assign roles

Privacy management uses a role-based access control (RBAC) permission model. Only users who are assigned a role may access privacy management, and the actions allowed by each user are restricted by role type.

Permissions and role assignments for privacy management can be handled within the Microsoft 365 compliance center, as follows. Note that roles specific to privacy management will not appear in Azure Active Directory.

### In the Microsoft 365 compliance center

- Select Permissions in the left navigation.
- Expand Compliance Center and select Roles. The full list of role groups will appear. 
- Scroll to find the privacy management groups, or search by keyword, for example “privacy.”
- Select the relevant role group to see a description, the assigned roles, and a list of members.
- Use the Edit link beside these sections to add or change users or edit the settings.
  - Note that significantly editing or removing a role group or its key members may interfere with your or your team members’ ability to use privacy management.
