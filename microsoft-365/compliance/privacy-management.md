# Microsoft privacy management (preview)

## What is privacy management

As your company’s cloud data grows in size and complexity, so does your need to understand and safeguard the personal data held in your environment. Privacy management in Microsoft 365 empowers your employees to make smart data handling decisions and address critical privacy risks by providing efficient ways to find and manage personal data, automate privacy operations, and fulfill subject rights requests. These solutions will enable you to build a privacy resilient workplace and handle issues at scale.

## Risk management

The risk management features in privacy management give you insights into personal data within your Microsoft 365 environment and tools to automate your data handling strategies.

### Understand your data

To help you understand the scope of your data, see trends and highlights, and investigate areas of interest and concern, the **Overview** dashboard provides dynamic updates about privacy management’s evaluation of your Microsoft 365 data and helps you visualize your privacy landscape. Key findings and alerts help you assess the information, explore further details, and inform actions to take. You can also dive deeper into your data by reviewing analytics on your **data profile** page.

### Manage risk scenarios

Complex data environments can present potentially risky scenarios for personal data. Key areas to consider include:

- **Overexposed personal data**: Companies may collect various types of information that can be used to identify individual customers or employees. Access rights to this data must be properly managed to protect privacy and prevent inappropriate use.
- **Data transfers**: Transferring personal data between departments in your organization or across country or regional borders may increase the risk of exposure of data, or of stepping out of accordance with privacy regulations and laws.
- **Data minimization**: Companies may collect excess information or keep it longer than necessary, resulting in storage of unused personal data. This data should be minimized to help prevent privacy risks.

To help you address these risks and establish ongoing practices for handling these scenarios, privacy management provides built-in policy templates. You can use these to create policies that evaluate your Microsoft 365 data, alert you to potential issues, and help you remediate these issues. The templates can either be used as provided or customized to meet your company’s specific needs.

To learn more, see [Create and manage policies](privacy-management-policies.md).

## Manage subject rights requests

In accordance with certain privacy regulations, for example General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, individuals may make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. For companies that store large amounts of information, finding the relevant data may seem like a formidable task.

Privacy management in Microsoft 365 can help you handle these inquiries through the subject rights request solution. It provides automation and workflow capabilities for helping you search for subject data that you’ve stored in Microsoft 365, review the findings, select the appropriate files, and produce reports. Along the way, you can securely collaborate with other experts in your organization to bring the request to completion.

Note that this subject rights request solution provides additional capabilities beyond the original data subject requests (DSR) solution in the compliance center, and there is no connection or sharing of workflows between the two. The legacy DSR page will be retired at a later date.

To learn more, see [Manage subject rights requests](privacy-management-subject-rights-requests.md).

## How we evaluate your data

To comply with privacy regulations, you need to know where personal data is collected and how it moves across your organization. Privacy management shows where personal data is stored in your Microsoft 365 environment and delivers key insights to help you protect that data and remediate issues before they become problems.

### What privacy management evaluates

- Sensitive information, which we call personal data and is the data supported by Microsoft data classification, for example, name, address, or Social Security number
- Personal data of people connected to your organization, such as customers and employees
- Data handling activities of employees who work with personal data, such as file owners and business operations staff

For additional information about how Microsoft 365 defines sensitive information, see [Learn about sensitive information types](sensitive-information-type-learn-about.md).

### Where privacy management identifies personal data

The privacy management solution for Microsoft 365 evaluates data and files stored by your business in Microsoft 365’s cloud service to help you identify and manage privacy risks in that space. This includes:

- Microsoft Exchange
- Microsoft SharePoint
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Microsoft Teams

Since this focuses on the data specific to your business, any personal accounts your employees or customers may have on these services will not be in scope.
