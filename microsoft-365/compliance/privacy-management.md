# Microsoft privacy management (preview)

## What is privacy management

As your company’s cloud data grows in size and complexity, so does your need to understand and safeguard the personal data held in your environment. Privacy management in Microsoft 365 empowers your employees to make smart data handling decisions and address critical privacy risks by providing efficient ways to find and manage personal data, automate privacy operations, and fulfill subject rights requests. These solutions will enable you to build a privacy resilient workplace and handle issues at scale.

## Risk management

The risk management features in privacy management give you insights into personal data within your Microsoft 365 environment and tools to automate your data handling strategies.

### Understand your data

To help you understand the scope of your data, see trends and highlights, and investigate areas of interest and concern, the **Overview** dashboard provides dynamic updates about privacy management’s evaluation of your Microsoft 365 data and helps you visualize your privacy landscape. Key findings and alerts help you assess the information, explore further details, and inform actions to take. You can also dive deeper into your data by reviewing analytics on your **data profile** page.

### Manage risk scenarios

Complex data environments can present potentially risky scenarios for personal data. Key areas to consider include:

- **Overexposed personal data**: Companies may collect various types of information that can be used to identify individual customers or employees. Access rights to this data must be properly managed to protect privacy and prevent inappropriate use.
- **Data transfers**: Transferring personal data between departments in your organization or across country or regional borders may increase the risk of exposure of data, or of stepping out of accordance with privacy regulations and laws.
- **Data minimization**: Companies may collect excess information or keep it longer than necessary, resulting in storage of unused personal data. This data should be minimized to help prevent privacy risks.

To help you address these risks and establish ongoing practices for handling these scenarios, privacy management provides built-in policy templates. You can use these to create policies that evaluate your Microsoft 365 data, alert you to potential issues, and help you remediate these issues. The templates can either be used as provided or customized to meet your company’s specific needs.
