# Records management in Microsoft 365

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Organizations of all types require a records-management solution to manage regulatory, legal, and business-critical records across their corporate data. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps an organization manage their legal obligations, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer required to be retained, no longer of value, or no longer required for business purposes.

Records management in Microsoft 365 provides the following capabilities:

- **Label content as a record**. Create and publish retention labels that mark content as a [record](records.md) that can then be applied by end users or [auto-applied](apply-retention-labels-automatically.md) by identifying sensitive information, keywords, or content types.

- **Migrate and manage your retention requirements with file plan**. By using a [file plan](file-plan-manager.md), you can bring in an existing retention plan to Microsoft 365, or build a new one for enhanced management capabilities.

- **Establish retention and deletion policies within the record label**. Define [retention](create-retention.md#retaining-content-for-a-specific-period-of-time) and [disposition](create-retention.md#deleting-content-thats-older-than-a-specific-age) periods based on various factors that include the date last modified or created.

- **Trigger event-based retention** with [event-based retention](event-driven-retention.md).

- **Review and validate disposition** with [disposition reviews](disposition.md#disposition-reviews) and proof of [records deletion](disposition.md#disposition-of-records).

- **Export information about all disposed items** with the [export option](disposition.md#filter-and-export-the-views).

- **Set specific permissions** for records manager functions in your organization to [have the right access](../security/office-365-security/permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

With the records-management solution in Microsoft 365, you can incorporate your organizationâ€™s retention schedules into the file plan to manage retention, records declaration, and disposition to support the full lifecycle of your content.
