# Resources to help you meet regulatory requirements for information governance and records management

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

Use the resources on this page to help you meet specific regulatory requirements for information governance and records management in Microsoft 365.

Downloaded the resources from the [Data Protection Resources, FAQ and White Papers](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/TrustDocuments?command=Download&downloadType=Document&downloadId=9fa8349d-a0c9-47d9-93ad-472aa0fa44ec&docTab=6d000410-c9e9-11e7-9a91-892aae8839ad_FAQ_and_White_Papers) page of the Service Trust Portal.

## Cohasset assessment for SEC 17a-4(f), FINRA 4511(c), and CFTC 1.31(c)-(d)

Applicable workloads: Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Skype for Business

Name: **Cohasset Assessment - Microsoft 365 - SEC Rule 17a-4(f) - Immutable Storage for SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Exchange, and Skype**

Released November 2020, this report has been produced in partnership with Cohasset Associates, Inc. (Cohasset) to assesses the capabilities of Microsoft 365 services for recording, storing and managing requirements for electronic records, as specified by:  

- Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 17 CFR § 240.17a-4(f), which regulates exchange members, brokers or dealers.  

- Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 4511(c), which defers to the format and media requirements of SEC Rule 17a-4(f).  

- The principles-based electronic records requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 17 CFR § 1.31(c)-(d).

The opinion from Cohasset is that when compliance features are properly configured and carefully applied and managed as described in their report, the assessed Microsoft 365 services meet the five requirements related to the recording and non-rewriteable, non-erasable storage of electronic records.
