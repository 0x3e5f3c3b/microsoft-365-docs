# Search and purge chat messages in Teams

You can use Advanced eDiscovery and the Microsoft Graph Explorer to search for and delete chat messages in Microsoft teams. This can help you find and remove sensitive information or inappropriate content.

## Before you search and purge chat messages

- To create an Advanced eDiscovery case and use collections to search for chat messages, you have to be a member of the **eDiscovery Manager** role group in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. To delete chat messages, you have to be assigned the **Search And Purge** role. This role is assigned to the Data Investigator and Organization Management role groups by default. For more information, see [Assign eDiscovery permissions](assign-ediscovery-permissions.md).

- A maximum of 10 items per mailbox can be removed at one time. Because the capability to search for and remove chat messages is intended to be an incident-response tool, this limit helps ensure that chat messages are quickly removed.
