# Sensitivity labels in Office apps

Read this article to find out:

- Requirements for your environment before you apply sensitivity labels to email, files, and attachments.
- Which sensitivity label capabilities are supported by each Office app.
- What happens when you combine sensitivity labels with other Microsoft security and compliance technologies that work with Office apps.
- How people in your organization can use sensitivity labels when they work with Office apps for Windows and Office apps for the web.
- Where to go to get people in your organization started with sensitivity labels.

## Subscription and licensing requirements for sensitivity labels

Users must have at least one of the following licenses assigned:

- [Microsoft 365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans) or above

- [Office 365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-enterprise-e3-business-software) or above

- [Azure Information Protection Premium P1](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection/) or above

Office 365 only supports sensitivity labels with a subscription and not with a non-subscription (standalone) version such as Office 2016 or Office 2019.

## Support for sensitivity label capabilities in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

> [!WARNING]
> @REVIEWERS - Mike, I need you to vet this line: Where support exists for a capability, the following table provides the minimum build number you need to use sensitivity labels for the app. TBD indicates that we don't yet have support for that capability on that platform. For information about future releases, and upcoming features, see *** MIKE I need a link here.

## Support for sensitivity label capabilities in Outlook

> [!WARNING]
> @REVIEWERS - Mike, I need you to vet this line same as above: Where support exists for a capability, the following table provides the minimum build number you need to use sensitivity labels for that type (hard to use 'version' here because of build #) of Outlook. TBD indicates that we don't yet have support for that capability for that *type*(?) of Outlook. For information about future releases, and upcoming features, see *** MIKE I need a link here. Also, Support AutoSave and co-authoring on labeled and protected documents is n/a for Outlook, so it's not in this table.

In your label configuration, if you turn on content marking, you must be using Exchange Online for that content marking to be inserted in transit.

## About the Office built-in labeling client

The Office built-in labeling client downloads labels and policy settings from the following admin centers:

- Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

- Microsoft 365 security center

- Microsoft 365 compliance center

To use the Office built-in labeling client, either temporarily or permanently uninstall or disable the the Azure Information Protection add-in.

1. Complete one of these options:

    **For multiple computers:** Configure theâ€¯**Use the Sensitivity feature in Office to apply and view sensitivity labels** Group Policy setting. Find this setting under **User Configuration/Administrative Templates/Microsoft Office 2016/Security Settings**. Deploy this setting through traditional group policy deployment mechanisms, or by using the [Office cloud policy service](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-office-cloud-policy-service).

    **For a single computer:** See "View, manage, and install add-ins in Office programs" for information about how to [permanently disable or remove](https://support.office.com/article/16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d) the Azure Information Protection add-in on a single computer.

2. Restart all Office applications.

For more information about client apps for information protection, see [Choose which labeling client to use](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/use-client#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use) in "The client side of Azure Information Protection".

## Protection templates and sensitivity labels

Administrator-defined [protection templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-templates), such as those you define for Office 365 Message Encryption, are hidden from the Office user experience when sensitivity labels are enabled because they are redundant with sensitivity labels that have encryption enabled.

## Apply classifications to files, emails, and attachments

Users can apply just one label at a time for each document or email.

When you label an email message that has attachments, those attachments do not inherit the same label. The attachments remain either without a label or retain a separately applied label. However, if the label for the email applies protection, that protection is applied to Office attachments.

## Support for SharePoint and OneDrive files protected by sensitivity labels

## When Office 365 applies marks and encryption to content

Office 365 applies content marks or encryption with a sensitivity label differently depending on the application you use.

| Application | Content marking | Encryption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Word, Excel, PowerPoint on all platforms | Immediately | Immediately |
| Outlook for PC and Mac | After Exchange Online sends the email | Immediately |
| Outlook on the web, iOS, and Android | After Exchange Online sends the email | After Exchange Online sends the email |
|
