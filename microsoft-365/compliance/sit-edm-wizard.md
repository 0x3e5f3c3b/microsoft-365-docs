# Use the Exact Data Match Schema and Rule Package Wizard

[Creating a custom sensitive information type with Exact Data Match (EDM) based classification](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md)  involves many steps.  You can use this wizard to create your schema and pattern (rule package) files to help simplify the process.

This wizard can be used instead of the:

- [Define the schema for your database of sensitive information](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#define-the-schema-for-your-database-of-sensitive-information)
- [Set up a pattern (rule package)](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#set-up-a-rule-package)

steps in [Part 1: Set up EDM-based classification](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#part-1-set-up-edm-based-classification)

## Pre-requisites

1. Familiarize yourself with the steps to create a custom sensitive information type with EDM [work flow at a glance](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#the-work-flow-at-a-glance).

2. Perform the steps in the [Save sensitive data in .csv format](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#save-sensitive-data-in-csv-format) section.

## Post steps

After you have used this wizard to create your EDM schema and pattern (rule package) files, you still have to perform the steps in [Part 2: Hash and upload the sensitive data](create-custom-sensitive-information-types-with-exact-data-match-based-classification.md#part-2-hash-and-upload-the-sensitive-data) before you can use the EDM custom sensitive information type.
