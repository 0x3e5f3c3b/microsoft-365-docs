# Advanced eDiscovery workflow for content in Microsoft Teams

This article provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for using Advanced eDiscovery to preserve, collect, review, and export content in Microsoft Teams. The goal of this article is to help you optimize your eDiscovery workflow for Teams content.

There are four categories of Teams content that you can collect and process using Advanced eDiscovery:

- **Teams group chats**. Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between three or more people. Also called *1:N* chats or *group conversations*.

- **Teams channels**. Chat messages, posts, replies, and attachments shared in a Teams channel.
