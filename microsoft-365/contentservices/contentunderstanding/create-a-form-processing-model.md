### Project for the web and the Common Data Service

When Project for the web is first used in your Microsoft 365 tenant, a default CDS instance is provided to your tenant.  Project for the web data (such as projects or roadmaps) is stored in solutions in the default instance.

Admins can find the name and details of their default CDS instance in the PowerApps admin center (admin.powerapps.com).
