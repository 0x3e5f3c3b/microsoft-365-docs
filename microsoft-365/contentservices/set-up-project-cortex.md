# Set up Project Cortex

- Set up your knowledge network
- Build AI models to understand content

> [!Important]
> It is important to plan the best way to set up and configure Project Cortex for your environment.  For example, who should you initially give access to and which sites do I analyze?  Much of this type of information is needed during the setup steps. Before going through the setup steps, make sure to [make all your planing considerations]().
