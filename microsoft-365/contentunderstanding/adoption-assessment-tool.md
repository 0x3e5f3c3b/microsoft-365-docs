# Assess your environment for Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool and all other PnP components are open-source tools backed by an active community providing support for them. There is no SLA for open-source tool support from official Microsoft support channels. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can only be run against SharePoint Online. 

You can run a SharePoint Syntex assessment using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. You will generate a report that summarizes aspects of your SharePoint information architecture that are indicators for where SharePoint Syntex might be of value. The assessment output includes a Power BI report comprising of the following: 

- **Libraries with custom columns** – Identify libraries where SharePoint Syntex can automatically populate columns, improving consistency. 

- **Column usage** – Identify patterns of column usage, to target SharePoint Syntex models where they will have the maximum benefit. 

- **Libraries with custom content types** – Identify libraries using custom content types, where SharePoint Syntex models can be used to automatically categorize files. 

- **Content type usage** – Identify patterns of content type usage, to target Sharepoint Syntex models where they will have the maximum benefit. 

- **Libraries with retention labels** – Identify libraries where retention labels are used, where SharePoint Syntex can be used to automate and improve consistency. 

- **Library size** – Identify large libraries where classification and metadata can improve the content discovery experience. 

- **Library modernization status** – Identify libraries that might need to be modernized to fully make use of SharePoint Syntex. 

- **Prebuilt model candidates** – Identify libraries where names or content types suggest a prebuilt model could be applied. 

- **Syntex model usage** – Review the current use of Syntex models in your sites. 

- **Assessment overview** – Review the assessment results to identify any failures.
