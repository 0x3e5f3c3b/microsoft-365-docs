# Create a rule to move or copy a file from one document library to another in Microsoft Syntex

From a document library, you can use Microsoft Syntex to create rules to automate tasks such as sending someone a notification when metadata changes in a file or when a new file is created in the library.

You'll choose a condition that triggers the rule and the action that the rule will take. 
For example, you can create a rule to move files tagged with a specific customer to a specific library or folder. This helps you structure your content architecture with the power of AI-driven processing.

## Move a file

To move a file from one document libary to another, follow these steps.

1. In the document library of the file you want move, select **Automate** > **Rules** > **Create a rule**.
