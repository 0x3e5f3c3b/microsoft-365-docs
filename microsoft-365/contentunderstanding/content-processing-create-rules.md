# Create a rule to move or copy a file to another document library in Microsoft Syntex

In a document library, you can use Microsoft Syntex to create rules to automate tasks such as sending someone a notification when metadata changes in a file or when a new file is created in the library.

You'll choose a condition that triggers the rule and the action that the rule will take. 
For example, you can create a rule to move files tagged with a specific customer to a specific library or folder. This helps you structure your content architecture with the power of AI-driven processing.

## Move a file to another document library

1. In the document library, select **Automate** > **Rules** > **Create a rule**.

2. On the **Create a rule** page, select a condition that triggers the rule and the action that the rule will take. In this case, select **When a new file is added"".
