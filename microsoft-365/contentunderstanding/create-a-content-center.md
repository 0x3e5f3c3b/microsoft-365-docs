To create and manage document understanding models, you first need a Content Center. The Content Center is the model creation interface and also contains information about which document libraries published models have been applied.

An initial Content Center is created during setup, but a SharePoint admin can choose to create additional ones as needed.

A SharePoint admin can create a Content Center site like they would [create any other SharePoint site](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/create-site-collection) - through a site template.

To create a new Content Center:

1. On the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the SharePoint admin center.
2. On the SharePoint admin center, under **Sites**, select **Active Sites**.
3. On the **Active Sites** page, click **Create**, and then select **Other options**.
4. On the **Choose a template** menu, select **Content Center**.
5. For the new site, provide a **Site Name**, **Primary administrator**, and a **Language**.</br>

> [!Note] 
> You can select a Content Center site to render in any of the available languages, but note that currently models can only be created for English files.</br>

6. Click **Finished**.

### Give access to additional users
 
After the site is created, you can give additional users access to the site through the standard [SharePoint site permissions model](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/modern-experience-sharing-permissions).
