# Activate a model on a local SharePoint site with Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

SharePoint Syntex now provides an option to create and train models locally on your own SharePoint site. You do not need to publish them to a content center. 

By activating document classification and extraction on your SharePoint site, SharePoint Syntex lets you classify files in document libraries, extract information from new files, and automate activities based on extracted information.

When you activate model creation on your site, the following lists and libraries will be added to your site:

- Models document library
- Training files document library
- Explanation templates list
- Model usage list


Activate a model

1. From a SharePoint document library, select the files you want to analyze, and then select **Classify and extract**.

2. The first time you use this feature, you will see the following message.

3. Select **Activate** to continue.
