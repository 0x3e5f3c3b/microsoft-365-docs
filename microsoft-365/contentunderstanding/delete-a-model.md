# Delete a model in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

At some point, you might want to delete a document understanding model. Before you delete a model, you must remove the model from all of the SharePoint document libraries where it has been applied.

## Remove a model from a library

You can remove a model from a document library either from the model home page, or from the document library (**Automate** > **View applied models** > **Remove from library**).

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a model does not delete the associated content type. 

## Delete a model

Follow these steps to rename a document understanding model.

1. From the content center, select **Models** to see your models list.

2. On the **Models** page, select the model you want to rename.

3. By using either the ribbon or the **Show actions** button (next to the model name), select **Delete**. </br>
