# Difference between document understanding and form processing models (Preview)

> [!Note] 
> The content in this article is for Project Cortex Private Preview. [Find out more about Project Cortex]().

Content Understanding in Project Cortex allows you to create and use two different types of models:

- Document understanding models
- Form processing models

## Key differences


### Structured versus Unstructured content




### Where they are created

Document understanding models are created and managed in a SharePoint content center site. You must have access to a content center site to create a document understanding model and to apply one to your SharePoint document library.

Form processing models are created in PowerApps AI Builder, but the creation is initiated directly from a SharePoint Document library. Form processing creation needs to be enabled on your document library in order for a user to create a form processing model for it, and a admin can do this in the Knowledge Management admin settings.

### Where they can be applied

Document Understanding models can be applied to different SharePoint document libraries that you have access to. They can be applied to different document libraries through the content center site.

Form processing models can only be applied to the SharePoint document library from which they were created.

## When would I use one over the other?
