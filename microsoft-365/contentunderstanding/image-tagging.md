# Image tagging in SharePoint Syntex

By default, basic image tagging is turned on for SharePoint and OneDrive. Images uploaded to either location are automatically scanned and applicable tags are applied, if available, from a list of 37 basic tags. Users with permissions to the image file can see the tags applied in the file information panel.



Users can find images based on the content of the image from Search. 


Users can add or remove tags in OneDrive, the SharePoint Document Library View and the search results page.  


When an image is uploaded, the tagger module is run.  If there are tags associated with the image, a column is added with the tags. 

When a user edits the tag column, mark it so that tags are never regenerated by the system going forward.   

When an image is edited, the tagger module is run.  If the tags column has not been previously edited by a user, apply new tags to the image.  If the tags column has been previously edited by a user, do not apply new tags to the image. 



Turning on and off the feature 

In the admin center, there will be a toggle to turn off tags or to reduce to the basic 37 tags.  When the admin turns off tags, the tagger will still run so that we can implement our cost optimization on OCR, but tags will not be populated in the metadata column. (3 states for a tenant – no tags, 37 tags, thousands of tags)
