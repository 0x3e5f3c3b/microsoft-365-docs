# Image tagging in SharePoint Syntex

By default, basic image tagging is turned on for SharePoint and OneDrive. Images uploaded to either location are automatically scanned and applicable tags are applied, if available, from a list of 37 basic tags. Users can find images through search by searching on the image tags.

When a user uploads an image, the  tagging process runs automatically. If an image is edited, the tagging process runs again to update the tags.

Users with permissions to the image file can see and edit the tags in the file information panel or in the search results page. Once a user edits an image's tags, the system no longer performs auto-tagging on that image, even if it is edited.

If you turn tagging off, images will no longer be automatically tagged. Existing tags will not be removed.

## Configure image tagging

You can configure image tagging in the Microsoft 365 admin center.â€¯
