# Import a term set using SKOS

1.	In the modern term store in the SharePoint admin center, select the desired term group
2.	In the command bar, select ‘Import term set’
 
3.	If you want to download a sample file to use as a template, select ‘sample-metadata.ttl’ to get a sample file that uses the new format
 
4.	Create the import file that contains the term sets & terms you wish to define using the vocabulary
5.	Under ‘File format’, select ‘SKOS (*.ttl)’
 
6.	Select ‘Browse’ and navigate to and add your prepared import file
7.	Select ‘Import’
On successful import of the file, a success message will be displayed, and the term store will refresh and you can navigate to the newly created term sets.
Note: 
•	Dismissing the Import panel will interrupt the import process.
•	It is recommended to keep your import files to less than 20,000 terms. Larger files can increase the time taken for validation & import.
