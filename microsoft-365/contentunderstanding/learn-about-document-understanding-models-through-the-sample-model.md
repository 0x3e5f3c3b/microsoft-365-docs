# Learn about document understanding models through the sample model

Microsoft SharePoint Syntex provides you a with sample model that you can examine to help give you a better understanding of how to create your own models. It allows you to not only examine model components such as its classifier, extractors, and explanations, but also the example files that are used to train the model.

## Import the sample model

To be able to access the sample model, you first need to import it to your content center.

1. On the content center, select **Models** to see your models list.</br>
2. In **Models** page, select **Import sample model**.</br>

    ![Import sample model](../media/content-understanding/import-sample-model.png) </br>

3. The sample model, titled *BenefitsChangeNotice.classifier*, will appear in your models list.</br>

    ![Sample model](../media/content-understanding/sample-model.png) </br>

4. Select the *BenefitsChangeNotice.classifier* to open the model home page.</br>
  
     ![Sample model](../media/content-understanding/sample-home-page.png)

From the model home page, you can examine the model more closely to see how it was created.

 
- View the sample files that were used to train the model.
- Examine the model's entity extractors more closely to see how the explanations were configured.
