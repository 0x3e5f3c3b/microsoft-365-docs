# Search for metadata in document libraries in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

The advanced metadata search feature for document libraries in SharePoint Syntex lets you easily perform specific metadata-based queries, rather than just keyword searches or write a query in Keyword Query Language (KQL). You can make a metadata-based search from a SharePoint document library in SharePoint Syntex. This lets you make more specific queries based on specific metadata column values. 

Licensed Syntex users can invoke metadata-based search in SharePoint document libraries.  When they click the icon in the search box, a flyout appears with five fixed fields.  End users can use these fields to more easily search using metadata.  

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for users who are licensed for SharePoint Syntex. 

## To use advanced metadata search

1. On a SharePoint document library page, in the search box, click or tap the metadata search icon.

2. In the metadata search pane, type in one of the search fields.

Currently, you can search on five fields. More fields will be available in the future.

|Field  |Purpose  |
|---------|---------|
|Keywords |Search for a string match in metadata or in the full text of the document. |
|Name     |Search in the **Name** column in the library.          |
|People   |Search for a match on people in any column in the library.   |
|Modified |Search in the **Modified** column in the library.         |
|Type     |Search by file type.        |
