# Search for metadata in document libraries in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

The advanced metadata search feature for SharePoint document libraries in SharePoint Syntex lets you easily perform specific metadata-based queries. You can now make faster,  more precise queries based on specific metadata column values, rather than just searching for keywords or writing search queries in Keyword Query Language (KQL). 

End users can use these fields to more easily search using metadata. Advanced search can be faster and can find any metadata or content (within the search scope).  

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for users who are licensed for SharePoint Syntex. 

## To use advanced metadata search

1. From a SharePoint document library in SharePoint Syntex, in the search box, click or tap the metadata search icon.

2. In the metadata search pane, type the string you want to find in one of the search fields.

Currently, five metadata search fields are available. More fields will be added in the future.

|Field  |Purpose  |
|---------|---------|
|Keywords |Search for a string match in metadata or in the full text of the document. |
|Name     |Search in the **Name** column in the library.          |
|People   |Search for a match on people in any column in the library.   |
|Modified |Search in the **Modified** column in the library.         |
|Type     |Search by file type.        |
