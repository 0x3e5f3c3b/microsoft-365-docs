# Use model discovery in Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

You can make your trained document understanding models available for others to view and use directly from the SharePoint document library. This feature is not yet available for form processing models.

You can also find and evaluate trained models in other content centers that were created by others in your organization. You can then select the model that is most useful for classifying your files or extracting specific information from them. You can evaluate up to 10 models against your content to help you find the most appropriate one.

## Make your model discoverable to others

To make your trained model available for others to use:

1. On the **Models** page, select **Model settings**.

2. On the **Model settings** pane, in the **Where this model is visible** section, select where you want the model to be visible for other users to apply:

   - **Not visible** – The model will not be available for others to use.
   - **On all sites** – The model will be available in the content type gallery for others to use.
   - **Only on specific sites** – You can choose which site or sites in which the model to be available. If you select this option, click in the text box to choose which sites you want the model applied.
