# Overview of Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

SharePoint Syntex is a content understanding, processing, and compliance service that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully organize and classify documents in your SharePoint library â€“ transforming your data into knowledge.

AI and machine learning help you better understand your content by accurately and efficiently classifying and extracting relevant information. Rather than clicking and sorting through hundreds, or even thousands of files, SharePoint Syntex extracts data for you, streamlining the search and discovery process. This returns valuable time to you and your team. Not only can you dive deeper into your content to truly understand it, now you can also increase document insight and control.

With SharePoint Syntex, you use AI and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully organize and classify documents in your SharePoint library. Being able to work more effectively with your content and the data within it creates stronger business processes. If your team can label and categorize your content more accurately, you can use this information to implement better business processes. Greater organization of your data creates better organization of your business.

You achieve this in SharePoint Syntex by using models. There are three custom model types you can choose from:

- [Classify and extract by text pattern](document-understanding-overview.md)
- [Extract by layout](form-processing-overview.md)
- [Extract by text pattern and layout](extract-by-text-pattern-and-layout-overview.md)

Or, if you don't need to build a custom model, you can use a trained [prebuilt model](prebuilt-overview.md).
