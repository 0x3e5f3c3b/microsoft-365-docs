# Term store reports

To access the reports, select “Reports” > ”Content services” in the left navigation of the modern SharePoint admin center. 

The Content Services Reports page has the following reports: 

Term store operations: View the top operations that have taken place in your term store in a 15-day period and observe a trend of their daily volumes in that period. This is useful when you want to understand the nature of changes in your term store at a high level and identify any unexpected trends in volumes of operations.

Term store composition: View the distribution of types of terms between regular managed terms and enterprise keywords at present and choose to move multiple keywords to managed terms if desired. This is useful when you want to identify if your users have actively used the keywords feature and manually review them to identify potential candidates for managed terms.

Open and closed term sets: View the distribution of open & closed term sets at present and choose to convert them to closed if desired. This is useful if you want to understand how many term sets are allowing users to freely add terms, and decide to make them no longer accept user additions if the volumes are growing unexpectedly.

Terms without synonyms: View the number of terms in each of the added working languages that do not have synonyms defined. This is useful to get a sense of any languages that you may want to consider defining synonyms in. Synonyms help end users disambiguate and find the correct terms to tag their content with.
