# Use the Contracts Management site template for Microsoft SharePoint Syntex

The Contracts Management site is a ready to deploy and customizable SharePoint site template that helps your organization maximize the value of SharePoint Syntex. The site is designed to let you create a professional site that meets the contract managing and processing goals of your organization.

The Contract Management site includes pre-populated pages, web parts, and site navigation. The site can be customized to incorporate your organization's own branding, employee information, policy and planning information, and document repository.
