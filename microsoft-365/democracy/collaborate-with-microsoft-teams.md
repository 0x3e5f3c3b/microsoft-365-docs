# Collaborate with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app that helps your campaign stay organized and have conversations, from any devuce. You can use Teams to have instant conversations with others in the campaign or guests outside of the campaign. You can also make phone calles, host meetings, and share files.

## Best practices

When you create a team, here's what gets created:

- A new [Office 365 group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-groups)
- 
- A [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact) site and document library to store team files
- 
- An [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/exchange-teams-interact) shared mailbox and calendar
- 
- A OneNote notebook
- 
- Ties into other Office 365 apps such as Planner and Power BI


1. **Teams** - Find channels to belong to or create your own. Inside channels you can hold on-th-spot meetings, have conversations, and share files.

2. **Meetings** - See everything you've got lined up for the day or week. Or, schedule a meeting. This calendar syncs with your Outlook calendar.
 
3. **Calls** - In some cases, if your organization has it set up, you cna call anyone from Teams, even if they're not using Teams.

4. **Activity** - Catch up on all your unread messages, @mentions, replies, and more. 

Use the command box at the top to search for specific items or people, take quick actions, and launch apps.
