# Create a communications site for your campaign

Very short introduction about why to do this and why this recommended way. 

## Best practices

Include the following elements in your Communications site:

1. Add your campaign logo and colors as a header image and theme
2. Lead with your strategy, message, important documents, a directory, and FAQ in a Hero web part.
3. Include a candidate statement to the team in a Text web part.
4. Add campaign events to an Events calendar web part so everyone can see what's coming up.
5. Add photos that people can use or share to an Image gallery web part.

## Set it up

Short list of summary how-to steps (if brief) with links to any articles that go into more depth. Take a look at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/freelancetoolkit/internalcommunicationdownload.

## Admin settings

If there's something an admin needs to do to make this work, include a brief description of that task and a link to an article for the admin.
