# Create teams for collaboration in Microsoft Teams

Very short introduction about why to do this and why this recommended way. 

## Best practices

Create the following teams so you can communicate and collaborate securely:

1. **A Campaign Leads team** - set this up as a private team so that only your key campaign members can access it and discuss potentially sensitive concerns.
2. **A general Campaign team** - this is for everyone to use for day to day communications and work. Individuals, groups, or committees can set up channels in this team to do their work. For example, the event planning people can set up a channel to chat and coordinate logistics for campaign events.
3. **A partners team** - one where you can coordinate with your vendors, partners, or volunteers without allowing them into anything sensitive.

## Set it up

When you create a team, here's what gets created:

- A new [Office 365 group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-groups)
 
- A [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact) site and document library to store team files

- An [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/exchange-teams-interact) shared mailbox and calendar

- A OneNote notebook

- Ties into other Office 365 apps such as Planner and Power BI 

Use the command box at the top to search for specific items or people, take quick actions, and launch apps.

Create a private Team for just the campaign manager and candidate like this.
