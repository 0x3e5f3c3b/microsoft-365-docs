# Protect your administrator accounts

The administrative accounts you use to administer your Microsoft 365 environment include elevated privileges. These are valuable targets for hackers and cyber criminals. This article describes:
- How to setup an additional administrator account for emergencies.
- How to protect these accounts.

--CREATE THE SMALL BUSINESS VERSION OF THIS ARTICLE: [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access)--

Use administrator accounts only for administration. Admins should have a separate user account for regular, non-administrative use and only use their administrative account when necessary to complete a task associated with their job function. 


### Create a 2nd admin account [add procedure]
You'll need a 2nd admin account when configuring conditional access to ensure you don't lock yourself out. 

### Create a user account for yourself [add procedure]
Use your user account to participate in collaboration with your organization, including checking mail.


### Additional recommendations
- Be sure admin accounts are also set up for multi-factor authentication. We'll show you how to do this in [Configure conditional access policies](m365-democracy-conditional-access.md).
- Before using admin accounts, close out all unrelated browser sessions and apps, including personal email accounts.
- After completing admin tasks, be sure to log out of the browser session.
