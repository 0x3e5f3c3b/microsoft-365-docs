# Protect unmanaged Windows 10 PCs and Macs

## Protect a computer running Windows 10 or a Mac

The following are specific things you can do if you're computer is running Windows 10, or if you have a Mac.

## [Windows 10] (#tab/Windows 10)
**Turn on BitLocker device protection**
Bitlocker protects data when devices are lost or stolen. BitLocker Drive Encryption provides full disk encryption on Windows 10 PCs. If the device is lost or stolen unauthorized users can’t gain access to files on the protected drives, including files synced from OneDrive for Business.

Turn on BitLocker device protection 

**Protect your PC with Windows Defender**
When you start up Windows 10 for the first time, Windows Defender is on and actively helping to protect your PC by scanning for malware (malicious software), viruses, and security threats. Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC. Windows Update downloads updates for Windows Defender automatically to help keep your PC safe and protect it from threats.

**Turn on Windows Firewall**
You should always run Windows Firewall even if you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your device (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
