# How Microsoft 365 for Democracy affects users

Microsoft 365 for Democracy makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to your environment. The tradeoff is your users will need to be aware of how to work within this more secure environment. We understand a little extra patience is required, but it's worth it to keep your organization protected.

## Collaborate using Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and other Office 365 tools
Microsoft 365 makes it as easy as possible to collaborate and share securely. You can share files and videos directly from Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, Stream, and even from within a file. Sharing from within these tools helps keep your data from leaking. You can also add additional protection to sensitive data to prevent sharing outside your organization. 

## Setting up iPhones and Android devices
All users you add to your environment will need to take a few minutes to setup iPhones and Android devices to work securely:
- Setup devices to use multi-factor authentication with the autenticator app.
- Use Microsoft mobile apps, including Outlook Mobile, Word, OneDrive, and other Microsoft apps from the app store. The native mail apps that are included on iPhones and Android devices are not supported. 

After setting these up, your users will be prompted to use the authenticator app when accessing your organization data on these devices, indluding mail. 

## Setting up BYOD Macs and Windows PCs

## Setting up managed Windows 10 devices
We recommend your most important staff members use freshly aquired Windows 10 devices that you manage. We'll show you how to manage and secure these devices. This ensures that staff members that are the highest value target to hackers receive the most protection.
