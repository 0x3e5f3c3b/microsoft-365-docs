# Send encrypted email

Your admin can define rules to automatically encrypt messages that meet certain criteria. For instance, your admin can create a rule that encrypts all messages sent outside your organization or all messages that mention specific words or phrases. Any encryption rules will be applied automatically. 

## Set up

If you want to encrypt a message that doesn't meet a pre-defined rule or your admin hasn't set up any rules, you can apply a variety of different encryption rules before you send the message. To send an encrypted message from Outlook 2013 or 2016, or Outlook 2016 for Mac, select **Options > Permissions**, then select the protection option you need. You can also send an encrypted message by selecting the **Protect** button in Outlook on the web. For more information, see [Send, view, and reply to encrypted messages in Outlook for PC](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/send-view-and-reply-to-encrypted-messages-in-outlook-for-pc-eaa43495-9bbb-4fca-922a-df90dee51980?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

### Automatically encrypt email messages

You can also create mail flow rules to automatically protect email messages that are sent and received from your campaign. You can set up rules to encrypt any outgoing email messages and remove encryption from encrypted messages coming from inside your organization or from replies to encrypted messages sent from your organization.
