# Set up and assign Azure Active Directoy Premium P1
After you set up Microsoft 365 Business, add Azure Active Directory Premium P1 (Azure AD P1). Azure AD P1 helps protect access to your organization's information. For example, create policies to: 
- Prevent access to sensitive information outside of geographic locations that you specify.
-Prevent information from being saved or downloaded unless the device is registered with Microsoft 365 for your organization.

We recommned purchasing this plan for all Microsoft 365 users that might handle sensitive information.
