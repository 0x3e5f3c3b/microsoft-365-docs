# Add additional protection to secure your business data
After you set up Microsoft 365 Business, add Azure Active Directory Premium P1 (Azure AD P1). Azure AD P1 helps protect access to your organization's information. For example, create policies to: 
- Prevent access to sensitive information outside of geographic locations that you specify.
- Prevent information downloads to devices unless they are protected by Microsoft 365 for your organization. 
## Add additional protection with Azure AD P1
To add Azure Active Directoy Premium P1: 
1. Select **Billing** > **Purchase Services**. Scroll down to **Other categories that might interest you**, select **Security and identity**.
2. When **New purchase options display**, select **Azure Active Directoy Premium P1**. 
3. Select **Buy** and complete the purchase. 
We recommend purchasing one license for each Microsoft 365 user in your organization that might handle sensitive information. You don't have to buy them all now.
## Assign Azure AD P1 to users in your orgnization:
After you have purchased Azure Active Directoy Premium P1, add the license for all users or staff that will handle sensitive information:
1. In the admin center, select **Edit user**.
2. Select a user who will handle sensitive information and then select **Edit** next to product licenses.
3. Next to Azure Active Directory Premium P1, switch the slider to **On**.
4. Select **Save** and add Azure Active Directory Premium P1 for all other users that handle senstive information.
For organizations that handle sensitive data, we have three specific policies that we recommned. To set these up, see >>conditional access topic
