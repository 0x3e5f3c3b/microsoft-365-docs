# Set up meetings

Meetings in Teams include audio, video, and sharing. And because they're online, you'll always have a meeting space and never need a room or projector for your campaign. Teams meetings are a great way to come together with your staff and volunteers both inside and outside of your organization. You don’t need to be a member of your organization or even have a Teams account – to join a Teams meeting. For your political campaign, you can schedule and run online meetings using Microsoft Teams. You can include staff, volunteers, and guests outside your organization. During a meeting, you can share your screen, share files, assign tasks, and more.
