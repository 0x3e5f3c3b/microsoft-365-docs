# European Union data storage locations

If your business is located within the European Union (EU), your data will be stored in the EU. 

- **Data storage locations:** For businessed located in the EU, customer data at rest for the services will be stored in the EU as listed in **Table A** below. Whether the data is stored in a EU global geography datacenter or a datacenter geo will depend on which billing address you choose to use when you create the tenant and which services you use.  
 
- **About our EU global geography datacenters:** Data stored in an EU global geography datacenter may be stored in Austria, Finland, France, Iceland, or Netherlands. The locations where customer data may be stored can be changed except for core customer data. 
 
  Core customer data consists of: 

    - Exchange Online mailbox content (email body, calendar entries, and the content of email attachments) 

    - SharePoint Online site content and the files stored within those sites
     
    - Files uploaded to OneDrive for Business 

- **About our datacenter geos:** To support ongoing customer demand and usage growth, we continually build new datacenter geos to add capacity and compute resources. For countries in the two datacenter geos in the EU: Germany and France.

## Compute locations for businesses located in the EU  

When you initiate the use of any of the above services, the computations needed to provide the service for any service data stored in one of regional European datacenters (or in your country) will take place within that same geographic boundary unless a temporary data transfer (less than 24 hours) is needed to perform the calculation in a Microsoft datacenter located further away. 

If a temporary transfer is required, we will always employ state of the art encryption in the transfer and we will always return your data to your chosen data storage location immediately thereafter. We rely on our compliance with European law through the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for these temporary transfers, along with our supplemental measures to ensure the data is protected.
 
Customer data for Sway and Workplace Analytics will be stored and computed in the United States if you elect to use these services.
