## ADR Overview
[The 'What', 'Where', 'When' and 'Why' basics of ADR]

## Workloads Included
[List main ones based on contractual commitment (i.e., EXO, ODSP, Teams, Office Online, EOP and MDO) and a high-level schedule on when other workloads will be included, if applicable.]

## Migration Commitment
[We need to have the migration SLOs in place for all the workloads above; taking into account the move in and move-out capacities, workload migration processes (EXO: mailboxes; ODSP: files and site clusters; Teams: chat data and MAUs).]

## Country-specific List of Promises/Commitments for Existing and Future GoLocals
[We need a country-specific list of commitments for the first 15 GoLocals that are under the free Move Program commitment as well as future GoLocals that will not be eligible for that effort; especially ones coming that'll overlap w/ the ADR GA grace period: Poland is Apr. 4, 2023, Italy and Spain are July 2023.]
