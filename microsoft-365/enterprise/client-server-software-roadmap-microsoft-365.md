# Client and server software roadmap for Microsoft 365

Most enterprise organizations have a heterogeneous environment that includes multiple releases of operating systems, client software, and server software. Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes the most secure versions of these key components of your IT infrastructure. It also includes productivity features that are designed to take advantage of cloud technologies.

To maximize the business value of the Microsoft 365 Enterprise integrated suite of products, begin planning and implementing a strategy to migrate releases of:

- The Office client installed on your computers to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.
- The Office servers installed on your servers to their equivalent services in Microsoft 365.
- Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on your devices to Windows 10 Enterprise.

>[!Note]
>Support for Windows 7 ended on **January 14, 2020**. For more information, see the [end-of-support details](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020).

As you accomplish these migrations over time, your organization comes closer to the vision of the [modern workplace](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/04/27/making-it-simpler-with-a-modern-workplace/). This secure and integrated environment can help you unlock teamwork and creativity in your organization. And Microsoft 365 Enterprise enables and empowers you all along the way.

## Migration for Microsoft Office client products

Organizations both large and small, often use a combination of older versions of Office client products, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These older versions:

- Can be [updated](https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5) with the latest security updates and support fixes, but the process is sometimes manual and might not scale across your organization.
- Aren't optimized to leverage the Microsoft cloud technologies and help you digitally transform your business.
- Don't provide the latest features.

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. This version of the Office client products is available with a Microsoft 365 Enterprise license. It's installed and updated from the Microsoft cloud. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise includes security updates and the latest features. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/about-microsoft-365-apps).

### Office 2007

For versions of Office in the Office 2007 release, the end of support has already passed. For more information, see [Office 2007 end-of-support roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/office-2007-end-support-roadmap).

Rather than upgrading your computers that run Office 2007 to Office 2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016, consider:

1. Getting and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2007 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or during an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs updates automatically. It can take advantage of cloud-based services for enhanced security and productivity.

### Office 2010

For versions of Office in the Office 2010 release, support ended on **October 13, 2020**. For more information, see [Office 2010 end-of-support roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/office-2010-end-support-roadmap).

You might consider upgrading your computers that run Office 2010 to Office 2013 or Office 2016. But both of those versions must be manually updated. Instead, consider:

1. Getting and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2010 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or during an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs both security updates and new feature updates automatically. It can take advantage of cloud-based services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

### Office 2013 and Office 2016

The end-of-support roadmap for the Office 2013 and Office 2016 versions of Office hasn't yet been determined. In these versions, like Office 2010, you must still [install security updates](https://support.office.com/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5). This task might not scale well, depending on the size of your organization.

Rather than keeping your computers current with the latest security updates for Office 2013 or Office 2016, or updating your computers from Office 2013 to Office 2016, consider:

1. Getting and assigning a Microsoft 365 license for your users.
2. Uninstalling Office 2013 or Office 2016 on their computers.
3. Installing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, either individually or during an IT rollout. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps).

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise installs both security updates and new feature updates automatically. It can take advantage of cloud-based services in Microsoft 365 for enhanced security and productivity.

## Migration for Microsoft Office server products

Both large and small organizations often use a combination of older versions of the Office server products, such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server. These older versions:

- Should be updated with the latest security updates and support fixes. In some cases, these updates are released monthly.
- Aren't optimized to leverage the Microsoft cloud technologies that help you digitally transform your business.
- Don't include new productivity applications, such as Microsoft Teams.
- Don't include the latest security features, such as Exchange Advanced Threat Protection.

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes cloud-based versions of Office server services that use some of the same tools as on-premises versions of Office server software, such as web browsers and the Outlook client. These services are continually updated for security without involving IT, saving you the time it takes to maintain and update on-premises servers. These services also have new features enhancements that are not present in Office server software.

For information about migrating users and data for specific Microsoft 365 workloads:

- User mailboxes from Exchange Server to Exchange Online, see [Move mailboxes between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-deployment/move-mailboxes).
- SharePoint data from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online, see [Migrate your content to Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online).

Rather than upgrading your server products in the Office 2007 release with server products in the Office 2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016 releases, consider:

1. Migrating the data on your Office 2007 servers to Microsoft 365. To help with this, hire a Microsoft partner.
2. Rolling out the new functionality and work processes to your users.
3. When there is no longer a need for the on-premises servers running Office 2007 server products, decommissioning them.

### Office Server 2010
