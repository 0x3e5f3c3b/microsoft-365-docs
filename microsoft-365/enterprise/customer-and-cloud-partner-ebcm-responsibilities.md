# Transparency during service incidents

As a trusted partner, Microsoft  builds highly resilient cloud services that empower customers. When a service incident occurs, Microsoft recognizes that **timely**, **targeted**, and **accurate** communications are critical for customers. Microsoft notifies M365 administrators by updating the tenant-specific Service Health Dashboard (SHD) on the M365 Admin Portal. Service incident updates are provided on an hourly cadence or, if a different cadence is required, it will be stated in the SHD communication posting.
  






 
 
In most cases, when our monitoring systems detect an issue, we can isolate the affected customer base, whether this is a single customer, multiple customers, a region, or beyond. If a specific mailbox database is degraded, we're able to identify exactly which customers have users on the affected infrastructure. Our communications are therefore directed only to those customers who are impacted. If impact is difficult to ascertain, we expand our communications to the widest potential impact scope. Our approach is to be as targeted as possible, but to err on the side of broader communication, when the exact scope cannot be determined. 
 
Customers should use the Service Health and Continuity guide to learn about the different communication channels and how to monitor service health. 
 
In the event the M365 Admin center or the Service Health Dashboard within the Admin center are unavailable, you can monitor the status of M365 using our backup site: 
https://status.office365.com/. Additionally, we maintain a Twitter account (@MSFT365Status) where we will respond to reports of impact and post updates on SHD impacting events. 
The Admin App for M365 tenant administrators gives you the ability to connect with your organization's M365 service status on the go. M365 tenant administrators will have the ability to view service health information and maintenance status updates from their mobile devices. For more information, visit the Admin App FAQ. 
The M365 Service Communications API enables you to access M365 service communications for simplifying the monitoring of your environment. Connect to the API, receive real-time service health data, and publish the information on an internal dashboard to inform enterprise users of incidents. Distributing the information internally can decrease your helpdesk traffic during an outage. We provide several other methods for customers to implement their own monitoring solutions on top of those options mentioned above.   
For highly impacting incidents, Microsoft publishes Post Incident Reviews (PIR) to the SHD within the Admin center. PIRs contain key incident information useful for understanding the nature of the outage and generally contain the following sections: 
•	User Impact 
•	Scope of Impact 
•	Incident Start-End Date and Time 
•	Root Cause 
•	Actions Taken 
•	Next Steps 
Ancillary communications are available in the M365 Message Center, such as notice of upcoming changes, new features, or maintenance. 


Providing access to Microsoft 365 online services is a partnership between your organization and Microsoft. The following chart summarizes the balance of responsibility for both Microsoft and the customer during a service incident and regular operations.
