# Deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise is a combination of Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and Windows 10 Enterprise that: 

- Has intelligent security.
- Is integrated for simplicity.
- Unlocks creativity.
- Is built for teamwork.

These benefits are not realized just by obtaining the licenses for these three products, but by deploying them and their features in a specific way. This documentation set guides you through that deployment and the correct and required configuration of these products and their features.

There are two main phases to deploying Microsoft 365 Enterprise:

1. First, deploy the [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) for built-in security and integration for simplified management, which makes it easier to ensure your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.
2. Next, deploy [workloads](deploy-workloads.md) on top of the foundation infrastructure, to unlock creativity and teamwork in your organization.
