# Common identity and device access policies
This article describes the common recommended policies to help you secure Microsoft 365 Enterprise. 

This guidance discusses how to deploy the recommended policies in a newly provisioned environment. Setting up these policies in a separate lab environment allows you to understand and evaluate the recommended policies before staging the rollout to your pre-production and production environments. Your newly provisioned environment may be cloud-only or Hybrid.  

##Policy set 

The following diagram illustrates the recommended set of policies. It shows which tier of protections each policy applies to and whether the policies apply to PCs, phones and tablets, or both categories of devices.

The rest of this article describes how to configure these policies, using the order listed in this table. 

|Protection level|Policies|
|:---------------|:-------|
|**Baseline**|Require MFA when sign-in risk is *medium* or *high*|
|        |Require compliant PCs *or* approved apps|
|        |Block clients that don't support modern authentication|
|        |High risk users must change password|
|        |Define compliance policies|
|        |Define app protection policies|
|**Sensitive**|Require MFA when sign-in risk is *low*, *medium* or *high*|
|         |Require compliant PCs *and* mobile devices|
|**Highly regulated**|*Always* requrie MFA|
| | |

##Assigning policies to users
Before configuring policies, identify the Azure AD groups you are using for each tier of protection. Typically, baseline protection applies to everybody in the organization. A user who is included for both baseline and sensitive protection will have all the baseline policies applied plus the sensitive policies. Protection is cumulative and the most restrictive policy is enforced. 

A recommended practice is to create an Azure AD group for conditional access exclusion. Add this group to all of your conditional access rules under "Exlude." This gives you a method to provide access to a user while you troubleshoot access issues. This is recommended as a temporary solution only. Monitor this group for changes and be sure the exclusion group is being used only as intended. 

The following diagram provides an example of user assignment and exclusions.

![Example user assignment and exlusions for MFA rules](../images/identity-access-policies-assignment.png)

In the illustration the "Top secret project X team" is assigned a conditional access policy that requires MFA *always*. Be judicious when applying higher levels of protection to users. Members of this project team will be required to provide two forms of authentication every time they log on, even if they are not viewing highly regulated content.  

 All security groups created as part of these recommendations must be created with Office features enabled. This is specifically important for the deployment of Azure Information Protection (AIP) when securing documents in SharePoint Online.

## Require MFA when sign-in risk is medium or high
To create a new conditional access policy: 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure Dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy** as shown in the screen-shot below:

The following tables describe the appropriate settings necessary to express the policies required for each level of protection.

### Medium and above risk requires MFA

#### Data loss prevention
The goal for your device and app management policies is to protect data loss in the event of a lost or stolen device. You can do this by ensuring that access to data is protected by a PIN, that the data is encrypted on the device, and that the device is not compromised.

|Policy recommendation|Description|
|:--------------------|:----------|
|**Require user PC management**|Require users to join their Windows PCs to an Active Directory Domain or enroll their PCs into management with Microsoft Intune or System Center Configuration Manager.|
|**Apply security settings via group policy objects (GPO) or Configuration Manager policies for domain joined PCs**|Deploy policies that configure managed PCs to enable BitLocker, enable anti-virus, and enable firewall.|
|**Require user mobile device management**|Require that user devices used to access email are managed by Intune **or** company email is accessed only through mobile email apps protected by Intune App Protection policies such as Outlook for iOS or Android.|
|**Apply an Intune Device Compliance Policy on managed devices**|Apply an Intune Device Compliance Policy for managed corporate mobile devices and Intune-managed PCs that requires: a PIN with minimum length 6, device encryption, a healthy device (is not jailbroken, rooted; passes health attestation), and, if available, require devices that are **low** risk as determined by a third-party MTP like Lookout or SkyCure.|
|**Apply an Intune App Protection Policy for managed apps running on unmanaged devices**|Apply an Intune App Protection Policy for managed apps running on unmanaged, personal mobile devices to require: a PIN with minimum length 6, device encryption, and that the device is healthy (is not jailbroken, rooted; passes health attestation).|

### User impact

For most organizations, it is important to be able to set user expectations around when and for which conditions they will be expected to sign into Office 365 to access their email.  

Users typically benefit from single sign-on (SSO) except during the following situations:
* When requesting authentication tokens for Exchange Online:
  * Users may be asked to MFA whenever a **medium or above** sign-in risk is detected and users has not yet performed MFA in their current sessions.  
  * Users will be required to either use email apps that support the Intune App Protection SDK or access emails from Intune compliant or AD domain-joined devices.
* When users at risk sign-in, and successfully complete MFA, they will be asked to change their password.

## Sensitive
This section describes the recommendations for the sensitive tier of data, identity, and device protection. These recommendations are for customers who have a subset of data that must be protected at higher levels or require all data to be protected at these higher levels.

You can apply increased protection to all or specific data sets in your Office 365 environment. For example, you can apply policies to ensure sensitive data is only shared between protected apps to prevent data loss. We recommend protecting identities and devices that access sensitive data with comparable levels of security.

### Conditional access policy settings
#### Identity protection

You can give users single sign-on (SSO) experience as described in earlier sections. You only need to intervene when necessary based on [risk events](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-risk-events).   

* Require MFA on **low or above** risk sessions
* Require secure password change for high risk users

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[Password synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization) and [self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords) are required for this policy recommendation.

Users typically benefit from single sign-on (SSO) except under the following situations:
* When requesting authentication tokens for Exchange Online:
  * Users will be asked to MFA whenever a **low or above** sign-in risk is detected and users has not yet performed MFA in their current sessions.  
  * Users will be required to either use email apps that support the Intune App Protection SDK or access emails from Intune compliant or AD domain-joined devices.
* When users at risk sign-in, and successfully complete MFA, they will be asked to change their password.

## Highly regulated
This section describes the recommendations for the highly regulated tier of data, identity, and device protection. These recommendations are for customers who may have a very small amount of data that is highly classified, trade secret, or regulated data. Microsoft provides capabilities to help organizations meet these requirements, including added protection for identities and devices.

### Conditional access policy settings
#### Identity protection

For the highly regulated tier Microsoft recommends enforcing MFA for all new sessions.
* Require MFA for all new sessions
* Require secure password change for **high** risk users

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[Password synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization) and [self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords) are required for this policy recommendation.

#### Data Loss Prevention
The goal for these device and app management policies is to prevent data loss in the event of a lost or stolen device. This is done by ensuring that access to data is protected by a PIN, that the data is encrypted on the device, and that the device is not compromised.

For the highly regulated tier, we recommend requiring apps that support Intune App Protection policy running only on Intune compliant or domain-joined devices.

|Policy recommendation|Description|
|:--------------------|:----------|
|**Require user PC management**|Require users to join their Windows PCs to an Active Directory Domain, **or** enroll their PCs into management with Intune or Configuration Manager and ensure those devices are compliant with policies before allowing email access.|
|**Apply security settings via group policy objects (GPO) or Configuration Manager policies for domain joined PCs**|Deploy policies that configure managed PCs to enable BitLocker, enable anti-virus, and enable firewall.|
|**Require user mobile device management**|Require that devices used to access Office 365 email and files are managed by Intune or company email is accessed only through mobile email apps protected by Intune App Protection policies such as Outlook for iOS or Android.|
|**Apply an Intune Device Compliance Policy on managed devices**|Apply an Intune Device Compliance Policy for managed corporate mobile devices and Intune-managed PCs that requires: a PIN with minimum length 6, device encryption, a healthy device (is not jailbroken, rooted; passes health attestation), and, if available, require devices that are Low risk as determined by a third-party MTP like Lookout or SkyCure.|

### User impact
For most organizations, it is important to be able to set expectations for users specific to when and under what conditions they will be expected to sign into Office 365 files.

* Users configured as highly regulated will be required to re-authenticate with MFA after their session expires.
* When users at risk sign-in they will be asked to change their password after completing MFA.
* When requesting authentication tokens for Exchange Online:
  * Users will be asked to perform MFA whenever they begin a new session.  
  * Users will be required to use email apps that support the Intune App Protection SDK
  * Users will be required to access emails from Intune compliant or AD domain-joined devices.
