# Common identity and device access policies
This article describes the common recommended policies for securing access to cloud services, including on-premises applications published with Azure AD Application Proxy. 

This guidance discusses how to deploy the recommended policies in a newly-provisioned environment. Setting up these policies in a separate lab environment allows you to understand and evaluate the recommended policies before staging the rollout to your preproduction and production environments. Your newly provisioned environment may be cloud-only or hybrid.  

## Policy set 

The following diagram illustrates the recommended set of policies. It shows which tier of protections each policy applies to and whether the policies apply to PCs or phones and tablets, or both categories of devices. It also indicates where these policies are configured.

[![Common policies for configuring identity and device access](../media/Identity_device_access_policies_byplan.png)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/media/Identity_device_access_policies_byplan.png)
[See a larger version of this image](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/raw/public/microsoft-365/media/Identity_device_access_policies_byplan.png)

The rest of this article describes how to configure these policies. 

Using multi-factor authentication is recommended before enrolling devices into Intune for assurance that the device is in the possession of the intended user. You must also enroll devices into Intune before enforcing device compliance policies.

To give you time to accomplish these tasks, we recommend implementing the baseline policies in the order listed in this table. However, the MFA policies for sensitive and highly regulated protection can be implemented at any time.


|Protection level|Policies|More information|
|:---------------|:-------|:----------------|
|**Baseline**|[Require MFA when sign-in risk is *medium* or *high*](#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)| |
|        |[Block clients that don't support modern authentication](#block-clients-that-dont-support-modern-authentication)|Clients that do not use modern authentication can bypass conditional access rules, so it's important to block these|
|        |[High risk users must change password](#high-risk-users-must-change-password)|Forces users to change their password when signing in if high-risk activity is detected for their account|
|        |[Apply APP data protection policies](#apply-app-data-protection-policies)|One policy per platform (iOS, Android, Windows). Intune App Protection Policies (APP) are predefined sets of protection, from Level 1 to Level 3.|
|        |[Require approved apps and APP protection](#require-approved-apps-and-app-protection)|Enforces mobile app protection for phones and tablets|
|        |[Define device compliance policies](#define-device-compliance-policies)|One policy for each platform|
|        |[Require compliant PCs](#require-compliant-pcs-but-not-compliant-phones-and-tablets)|Enforces Intune management of PCs|
|**Sensitive**|[Require MFA when sign-in risk is *low*, *medium* or *high*](#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)| |
|         |[Require compliant PCs *and* mobile devices](#require-compliant-pcs-and-mobile-devices)|Enforces Intune management for PCs and phone/tablets|
|**Highly regulated**|[*Always* require MFA](#require-mfa-based-on-sign-in-risk)|
| | |

## Assigning policies to users
Before configuring policies, identify the Azure AD groups you are using for each tier of protection. Typically, baseline protection applies to everybody in the organization. A user who is included for both baseline and sensitive protection will have all the baseline policies applied plus the sensitive policies. Protection is cumulative and the most restrictive policy is enforced. 

A recommended practice is to create an Azure AD group for conditional access exclusion. Add this group to all of your conditional access rules under "Exclude". This gives you a method to provide access to a user while you troubleshoot access issues. This is recommended as a temporary solution only. Monitor this group for changes and be sure the exclusion group is being used only as intended. 

The following diagram provides an example of user assignment and exclusions.

![Example user assignment and exclusions for MFA rules](../media/identity-access-policies-assignment.png)

In the illustration the "Top secret project X team" is assigned a conditional access policy that requires MFA *always*. Be judicious when applying higher levels of protection to users. Members of this project team will be required to provide two forms of authentication every time they log on, even if they are not viewing highly-regulated content.  

All Azure AD groups created as part of these recommendations must be created as Microsoft 365 groups. This is specifically important for the deployment of Azure Information Protection (AIP) when securing documents in SharePoint Online.

![Screen capture for creating Microsoft 365 groups](../media/identity-device-AAD-groups.png)


## Require MFA based on sign-in risk
Before requiring MFA, first use an Identity Protection MFA registration policy to register users for MFA. After users are registered you can enforce MFA for sign-in. The [prerequisite work](identity-access-prerequisites.md) includes registering all users with MFA.

To create a new conditional access policy: 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy**.

![Baseline CA policy](../media/secure-email/CA-EXO-policy-1.png)

 The following tables describes the conditional access policy settings to implement for this policy.

**Assignments**

|Type|Properties|Values|Notes|
|:---|:---------|:-----|:----|
|Users and groups|Include|Select users and groups – Select specific security group containing targeted users|Start with security group including pilot users|

## Apply APP data protection policies
App Protection Policies (APP) define which apps are allowed and the actions they can take with your organization's data. The choices available in APP enable organizations to tailor the protection to their specific needs. For some, it may not be obvious which policy settings are required to implement a complete scenario. To help organizations prioritize mobile client endpoint hardening, Microsoft has introduced taxonomy for its APP data protection framework for iOS and Android mobile app management. 

The APP data protection framework is organized into three distinct configuration levels, with each level building off the previous level: 

- **Enterprise basic data protection** (Level 1) ensures that apps are protected with a PIN and encrypted and performs selective wipe operations. For Android devices, this level validates Android device attestation. This is an entry level configuration that provides similar data protection control in Exchange Online mailbox policies and introduces IT and the user population to APP. 
- **Enterprise enhanced data protection** (Level 2) introduces APP data leakage prevention mechanisms and minimum OS requirements. This is the configuration that is applicable to most mobile users accessing work or school data. 
- **Enterprise high data protection** (Level 3) introduces advanced data protection mechanisms, enhanced PIN configuration, and APP Mobile Threat Defense. This configuration is desirable for users that are accessing high risk data. 

To see the specific recommendations for each configuration level and the minimum apps that must be protected, review [Data protection framework using app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework). 

Using the principles outlined in [Identity and device access configurations](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md), the Baseline and Sensitive protection tiers map closely with the Level 2 enterprise enhanced data protection settings. The Highly regulated protection tier maps closely to the Level 3 enterprise high data protection settings.

|Protection level |App Protection Policy  |More information  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Baseline     | [Level 2 enhanced data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework#level-2-enterprise-enhanced-data-protection)        | The policy settings enforced in level 2 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1 and only adds to or updates the below policy settings to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 1.         |
|Sensitive     | [Level 2 enhanced data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework#level-2-enterprise-enhanced-data-protection)        | The policy settings enforced in level 2 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1 and only adds to or updates the below policy settings to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 1.        |
|Highly Regulated     | [Level 3 enterprise high data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-framework#level-3-enterprise-high-data-protection)        | The policy settings enforced in level 3 include all the policy settings recommended for level 1 and 2 and only adds to or updates the below policy settings to implement more controls and a more sophisticated configuration than level 2.        |

To create a new app protection policy for each platform (iOS and Android) within Microsoft Endpoint Manager using the data protection framework settings, administrators can:
1. Manually create the policies by following the steps in [How to create and deploy app protection policies with Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policies). 
2. Import the sample [Intune App Protection Policy Configuration Framework JSON templates](https://github.com/microsoft/Intune-Config-Frameworks/tree/master/AppProtectionPolicies) with [Intune's PowerShell scripts](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples).

## Require approved apps and APP protection
To enforce the APP protection policies you applied in Intune, you must create a conditional access rule to require approved client apps and the conditions set in the APP protection policies. 

Enforcing APP protection policies requires a set of policies described in in [Require app protection policy for cloud app access with Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access). These policies are each included in this recommended set of identity and access configuration policies.

To create the conditional access rule that requires approved apps and APP protection, follow "Step 1: Configure an Azure AD Conditional Access policy for Microsoft 365" in [Scenario 1: Microsoft 365 apps require approved apps with app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access#scenario-1-office-365-apps-require-approved-apps-with-app-protection-policies), which allows Outlook for iOS and Android, but blocks OAuth capable Exchange ActiveSync clients from connecting to Exchange Online.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This policy ensures mobile users can access all Office endpoints using the applicable apps.

If you are enabling mobile access to Exchange Online, implement [Block ActiveSync clients](secure-email-recommended-policies.md#block-activesync-clients), which prevents Exchange ActiveSync clients leveraging basic authentication from connecting to Exchange Online. This policy is not pictured in the illustration at the top of this article. It is described and pictured in [Policy recommendations for securing email](secure-email-recommended-policies.md).

 These policies leverage the grant controls [Require approved client app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-approved-client-app) and [Require app protection policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-app-protection-policy).

Finally, blocking legacy authentication for other client apps on iOS and Android devices ensures that these clients cannot bypass conditional access rules. If you're following the guidance in this article, you've already configured [Block clients that don't support modern authentication](#block-clients-that-dont-support-modern-authentication).

<!---
With Conditional Access, organizations can restrict access to approved (modern authentication capable) iOS and Android client apps with Intune app protection policies applied to them. Several conditional access policies are required, with each policy targeting all potential users. Details on creating these policies can be found in [Require app protection policy for cloud app access with Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access).

1. Follow "Step 1: Configure an Azure AD Conditional Access policy for Microsoft 365" in [Scenario 1: Microsoft 365 apps require approved apps with app protection policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access#scenario-1-office-365-apps-require-approved-apps-with-app-protection-policies), which allows Outlook for iOS and Android, but blocks OAuth capable Exchange ActiveSync clients from connecting to Exchange Online.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This policy ensures mobile users can access all Office endpoints using the applicable apps.

2. If enabling mobile access to Exchange Online, implement [Block ActiveSync clients](secure-email-recommended-policies.md#block-activesync-clients), which prevents Exchange ActiveSync clients leveraging basic authentication from connecting to Exchange Online.

   The above policies leverage the grant controls [Require approved client app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-approved-client-app) and [Require app protection policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-app-protection-policy).

3. Disable legacy authentication for other client apps on iOS and Android devices. For more information, see [Block clients that don't support modern authentication](#block-clients-that-dont-support-modern-authentication).

## Define device-compliance policies

Device-compliance policies define the requirements that devices must adhere to in order to be marked as compliant. Create Intune device compliance policies from within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.

Create a policy for each platform:
- Android device administrator
- Android Enterprise
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows Phone 8.1
- Windows 8.1 and later
- Windows 10 and later

To create device compliance policies, log in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with your administer credentials, and then navigate to **Devices** > **Compliance policies** > **Policies**. Select **Create Policy**.

For device compliance policies to be deployed, they must be assigned to user groups. You assign a policy after you create and save it. In the admin center, select the policy and then select **Assignments**. After selecting the groups that you want to receive the policy, select **Save** to save that group assignment and deploy the policy.

For step-by-step guidance on creating compliance policies in Intune, see [Create a compliance policy in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/create-compliance-policy) in the Intune documentation.

The following settings are recommended for Windows 10.

## Require compliant PCs (but not compliant phones and tablets)
Before adding a policy to require compliant PCs, be sure to enroll devices for management into Intune. Using multi-factor authentication is recommended before enrolling devices into Intune for assurance that the device is in the possession of the intended user. 

To require compliant PCs:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy**.

5. Enter a policy name, then choose the **Users and groups** you want to apply the policy for.

6. Choose **Cloud apps**.

7. Choose **Select apps**, select the desired apps from the **Cloud apps** list. For example, select Exchange Online. Choose **Select** and **Done**.

8. To require compliant PCs, but not compliant phones and tablets, choose **Conditions** and **Device platforms**. Choose **Select device platforms** and select **Windows** and **macOS**.

9. Choose **Grant** from the **Access controls** section.

10. Choose **Grant access**, select **Require device to be marked as compliant**. For multiple controls, select **Require all the selected controls**, then choose **Select**. 

11. Choose **Create**.

If your objective is to require compliant PCs *and* mobile devices, do not select platforms. This enforces compliance for all devices. 

## Require compliant PCs *and* mobile devices

To require compliance for all devices:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you see the Azure dashboard.

2. Choose **Azure Active Directory** from the left menu.

3. Under the **Security** section, choose **Conditional access**.

4. Choose **New policy**.

5. Enter a policy name, then choose the **Users and groups** you want to apply the policy for.

6. Choose **Cloud apps**.

7. Choose **Select apps**, select the desired apps from the **Cloud apps** list. For example, select Exchange Online. Choose **Select** and **Done**.

8. Choose **Grant** from the **Access controls** section.

9. Choose **Grant access**, select **Require device to be marked as compliant**. For multiple controls, select **Require all the selected controls**, then choose **Select**.
