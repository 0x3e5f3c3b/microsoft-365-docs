# Step 13: Azure AD access and usage reporting

![This step is optional and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise](./media/banners/Banner-Optional-BothSKUs.png)

**Summary:** 

With Azure AD reporting, you can view access and usage reporting information from two different sources:

- Audit logs that record the history of every task performed in your Azure AD tenant.
- Sign-ins record who has performed the tasks reported by the audit logs report.

The audit logs report allows you to address common questions such as: 

- Who added someone to an admin group? 
- Which users are signing into a specific app?
- How many password resets are happening?

The sign-ins activity report allows you to find answers to questions such as:

- For a specific user under investigation, what is their sign-in pattern?
- What is my volume of sign-ins over a day, a week, or a month?
- How many of these sign-in attempts were not successful, and for which accounts?

For more information about the reports and how to access them, see [Azure Active Directory reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-azure-portal).

The results of this step are the awareness of these reports and a determination of how you can use them to gain insights on Azure AD events and activities for planning and security purposes.

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md#crit-identity-step13) corresponding to this step.
