# Step 3: Customize the Office 365 sign-in page

![This step is optional and for both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise](./media/banners/Banner-Optional-BothSKUs.png)


**Summary:** 

When you apply a consistent look and feel across all the websites and services you manage that reflect the name, logo, and other recognizable elements of your organization’s brand, your end users aren't confused when they use your sites. 
With Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you can customize the appearance of the sign-in and Access Panel pages so they include your company logo, color schemes, and custom user information. 

When a user attempts to sign in from a device, they see something like the following example on the Office 365 sign-in page *before customization*.

And here is what the same user of the Contoso Corporation would see *after customization*.

For more information, see [Add your company branding to Office 365 Sign In page](https://support.office.com/article/Add-your-company-branding-to-Office-365-Sign-In-page-a1229cdb-ce19-4da5-90c7-2b9b146aef0a).

For configuration instructions, see [Add company branding to your sign-in and Access Panel pages](http://aka.ms/aadpaddbranding).

The result of this step is your organization’s logo, picture, and user information are visible in the Office 365 sign-in page for your organization.
