# Phase 2: Identity

In Microsoft 365 Enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

>[!Note]
>If you already have an identity infrastructure deployed, please see the [exit criteria](identity-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that your identity infrastructure meets the required and optional criteria for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
