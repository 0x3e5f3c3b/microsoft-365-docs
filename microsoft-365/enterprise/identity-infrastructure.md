# Phase 2: Identity infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

**Summary:** The steps and exit criteria to deploy the identity infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

>[!Note to readers:] 
> This document represents a work-in-progress and a prototype for a foundation infrastructure article in the Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment content set. At this time, this article is not intended to be a technically complete and product team-reviewed article ready for publication. 

Intelligent security for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, in which the right users have access to the right resources with an appropriate level of access, begins with identity management. Your identity infrastructure is the central underpinning upon which your additional foundation infrastructure (especially security) and your productivity workloads depend. A well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

If you already have an identity infrastructure deployed, please see the [Exit criteria article](phase2-identity-exit-criteria.md) to make sure that your identity infrastructure meets the required and optional criteria for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure 

Use the following steps to build out your new identity infrastructure in the cloud or to adapt your existing on-premises or hybrid identity infrastructure for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

- [Step 1: Customize the Office 365 sign-in page](phase2-step01-customize-Office-365-sign-in-page.md)
- [Step 2: Plan for users and groups](phase2-step02-plan-users-groups.md)
- [Step 3: Azure AD Connect](phase2-step03-azure-ad-connect.md)
- Step 4: Azure AD Connect Health
- Step 5: Azure AD Application Proxy
- Step 6: Multi-factor authentication
- Step 7: Designate and protect administrator accounts
- Step 8: Password reset
- Step 9: Password writeback
- Step 10: Single sign-on
- Step 11: Group-based licensing
- Step 12: Automatic group membership based on account attributes
- Step 13: Azure AD access and usage reporting
- Step 14: Self-service group management
- Step 15: Azure AD Identity Protection
- Step 16: Privileged Identity Management

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](phase2-identity-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required configuration for Microsoft 365.
