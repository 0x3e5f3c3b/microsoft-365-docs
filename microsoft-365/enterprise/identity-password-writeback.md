# Step 9: Simplify password updates

*This step is optional for hybrid environments and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In this step, you'll allow users to reset their passwords through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which is then replicated to your local Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). This process is known as password writeback. With password writeback, users donâ€™t need to update their passwords through the on-premises Windows Server AD where user accounts and their attributes are stored. This is valuable to roaming or remote users who do not have a remote access connection to the on-premises network.

Password writeback is required to fully utilize Identity Protection feature capabilities, such as requiring users to change their on-premises passwords when there has been a high risk of account compromise detected.

For additional information and configuration instructions, see [Azure AD SSPR with password writeback](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-writeback).

>[!Note]
>Upgrade to the latest version of Azure AD Connect to ensure the best possible experience and new features as they are released. For more information, see [Custom installation of Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom).
