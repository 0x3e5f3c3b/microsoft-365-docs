# Identity roadmap for Microsoft 365

In Microsoft 365 for enterprise, a well-planned and executed identity infrastructure paves the way for stronger security and access to your productivity workloads and their data only by authenticated users and devices.

Watch this video for an overview of identity models and authentication for Microsoft 365 for enterprise.

For the identity features of each Microsoft 365 for enterprise plan, the role of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), on-premises and cloud-based components, and the most common authentication configurations, see the [Identity Infrastructure poster](../downloads/m365e-identity-infra.pdf).

## Plan

In the planning phase of your identity implementation:

- Understand the different identity models
- Plan for hybrid identity and directory synchronization
- Understand which tools you can use to manage Microsoft 365 accounts

## Deploy

In the deployment phase of your identity implementation:

- Protect your global administrator accounts
- Configure and use cloud-only identities
- Configure and use hybrid identities
- Set up directory synchronization
- If needed, deploy hybrid identity scenarios

### Identity and device access recommendations

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. For identity, use the recommendations and settings in the following articles along with the steps in this phase:

- [Prerequisites](identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](identity-access-policies.md)

## Manage

In the management phase of your identity implementation:

- Assign licenses and manage user accounts
- Monitor directory synchronization
