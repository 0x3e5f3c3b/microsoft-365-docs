# Step 1: Define security and information protection levels

![This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise](./media/banners/Banner-Required-BothSKUs.png)

Most organizations have specific definitions and requirements for security and protecting data. For example, your research department users and its assets might require additional security and information protection that encrypts files and limits access to only research staff.

Although you can define your own security levels and might already have some in place, Microsoft recommendations that you use at least three different tiers of security and protection that can be applied: 

- **Baseline:** This is a minimum standard for protecting data and for the identities and devices that access your data. You can follow baseline security and protection recommendations to provide strong default protection that meets the needs of many organizations or their departments.
- **Sensitive:** This is a higher level of protection for a subset of your data that must be protected beyond those protections at the baseline level. You can apply this increased protection to specific data sets in your Office 365 environment. Microsoft recommends protecting identities and devices that access sensitive data with a sensitive security level. 
- **Highly regulated:** This is the highest level of protection for organizations that typically have a very small amount of data that is highly classified, considered intellectual property or trade secrets, or data that must adhere to strict security regulations. Microsoft 365 Enterprise has capabilities to help organizations meet these high security requirements, including equivalent protection for identities and devices.

For more information, see [Tiers of security and protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-enterprise/microsoft-365-policies-configurations#tiers-of-security-and-protection).


The result is a determination of your security and information protection levels.

As an interim checkpoint, see the exit [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md#crit-infoprotect-step1) corresponding to this step.
