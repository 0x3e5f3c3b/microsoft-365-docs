# Phase 6: Information protection infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Office 365 and Enterprise Management + Security (EMS), which includes a host of information protection capabilities and features to provide baseline to advanced security. In this phase, you step through the determination, configuration, and the enabling of information protection settings and features that make your infrastructure ready to host cloud-based workloads that store both your everyday to most valuable data, and those in between.

>[!Note]
>If you already have an information protection infrastructure deployed with elements of information protection already in place, please see the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required and optional criteria for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise information protection infrastructure 

Information protection infrastructure is not an IT-only function. You must work with your legal and compliance teams to determine if your organization needs to meet compliance standards such as HIPPA, CJIS, or GDPR. Also work within your organization to determine the objectives for information protection.

Next, use the following steps to build out your information protection infrastructure for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

- [Step 1: Define security and information protection levels](infoprotect-define-sec-infoprotect-levels.md)
- [Step 2: Configure conditional access policy settings](infoprotect-configure-conditional-access-policy-settings.md)
- [Step 3: Configure classification for your environment](infoprotect-configure-classification.md)
- [Step 4: Configure increased security for Office 365](infoprotect-configure-increased-security-office-365.md)

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](infoprotect-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required criteria for Microsoft 365.
