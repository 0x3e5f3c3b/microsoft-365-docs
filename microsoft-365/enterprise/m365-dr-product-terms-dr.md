There are no plans to add additional *Geographies* or Online services in the future.  For data residency support for *Expanded Local Geographies* or additional services, refer to the *Multi-Geo* service and/or the *Advanced Data Residency* service.

## Product Terms Data Residency Migration

When Microsoft’s data centers were launched in *Local Geographies*, it was possible for any tenant with the appropriate *Default Geography* to opt in to move their data into the *Local Geographies*. This opt in period was open for six months after the Data Center was operational.

Practically, this means that there are a number of tenants that did not opt in to move and remain in the *Regional Geography* data centers.  On our about Nov 1, 2022 with the introduction of the Advanced Data Residency add-on, all tenants that remain in the *Regional Geography* data centers will have another six month period to opt in for data migration to their *Local Geography*.  ***See section 7 for more information MUST PROVIDE PAGE LINK***.
