# Data Residency for Viva Topics

## Summary

Service documentation:  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/topics/topic-experiences-overview" target="_blank">**Microsoft Viva Topics overview**</a>

Capability summary: Viva Topics uses Microsoft AI technology, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph, Search, and other components and services to bring knowledge to your users in the Microsoft 365 apps they use everyday, starting with SharePoint modern pages, Outlook, Microsoft Search, and Search in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

## Data Residency commitments available

### Option 1: Advanced Data Residency add-on

Required Conditions:

1.	Tenant has a sign up country included in *Local Geography* or *Expanded Local Geography*.
2.	Tenant has a valid Advanced Data Residency subscription for all users in the tenant
3.	The Viva Topics subscription customer data is provisioned in *Local Geography* or *Expanded Local Geography*

**Commitment:**
The following customer data will be stored in the related *Geography*:

-All the topics and customer data snippets discovered are stored within the relevant *Geographies* in Exchange Online Substrate (site or arbitration mailboxes, and Substrate).  All topic customer data is partitioned based on which *Regional* or *Local Geography* the data came from within your tenant.

-ML models are trained on public web data, and as such do not contain any customer data from your tenant. In the future itâ€™s possible we will use customer data to improve accuracy of the ML models, in which case the data handling of ML models will follow the same policies as any other customer content (including data residency, retention, access control, sensitivity)

-Topic highlighting is computed dynamically when the SharePoint Online page is rendered by running a language model against the content of the page and linking it with the knowledge base of Topics.  The Topics data is sourced from the Substrate in the relevant *Geographies*.

-The administration configuration data is stored within the relevant *Geographies*.

## Migration 

Data storage is maintained within Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams.  Migration processes are handled in those workloads.
