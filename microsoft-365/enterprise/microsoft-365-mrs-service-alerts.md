# Service alerts for mailbox migration in Exchange Online monitoring

These service alerts inform you of storage limitations or high processor utilization for mailbox migrations that might be caused by issues on the tenant side (source side) and includes links to Microsoft documents on ways to resolve. 
These alerts are displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To view these alerts, navigate to Health > Service Health > Exchange Online > View and finally, the Active Issues tab.
