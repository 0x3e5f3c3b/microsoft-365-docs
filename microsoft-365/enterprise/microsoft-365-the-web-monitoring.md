# Microsoft 365 the web Monitoring 

You can use Office for the web monitoring in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) to monitor the health of the Office for the web service for your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription. Office for the web monitoring provides you with information about incidents and advisories related to any issue detected in the Microsoft 365 infrastructure that Microsoft owns for providing regular updates and resolving the issue. For example, users cannot open or save Excel for the web application because of issues with Excel or the Microsoft 365 cloud infrastructure. 

To go to the **Service health** dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Health > Service health**. 

Issues in your organization are identified and used by organizational-level monitoring. The value in the **Health** column under **Microsoft service health** indicates that the service is healthy or has advisories or incidents based on the cloud services that Microsoft maintains. 

Here’s an example of the Office for the web monitoring page in the Microsoft 365 admin center that shows the health of organization-level scenarios available by going to **Health > Service health > Office for the web**.

With the **Office for the web** monitoring page, you can see whether the Office for the web service is healthy or not and whether there are any associated incidents or advisories for any underlying Office for the web apps. With Office for the web monitoring, you can look at the service health for specific app scenarios and view near real-time signals to determine the impact by organization-level scenario.
