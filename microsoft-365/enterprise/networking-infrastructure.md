# Phase 1: Networking infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

**Summary:** The steps and exit criteria to deploy the networking infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Office 365 and Windows Intune as part of Enterprise Management + Security (EMS). Both of these cloud-based services rely on the security, performance, and reliability of connections over the Internet or dedicated circuits from client devices. Microsoft has designed the network that hosts these services and its connection to the Internet to enable customers all over the world to connect in a performant way.

In this phase, you step through the key considerations for creating a performant connection to the cloud services of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. For an overview, see [Office 365 networking principles](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Getting-the-best-connectivity-and-performance-in-Office-365/ba-p/124694).

>[!Note]
>If you already have a networking infrastructure deployed, please see the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required and optional criteria for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise networking infrastructure 

Use the following steps to build out your networking infrastructure for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

- [Step 1: Provide sufficient Internet bandwidth for Microsoft’s cloud services](networking-provide-bandwidth-cloud-services.md)
- [Step 2: Ensure that DNS resolution is performed in the same place as the Internet access](networking-dns-resolution-same-location.md)
- [Step 3: Configure your proxy servers and firewalls for unhindered access to Office 365](networking-configure-proxies-firewalls.md)
- [Step 4: Implement plan for endpoint change management](networking-implement-endpoint-change-mgmt.md)
- [Step 5: Optimize TCP and application performance](networking-optimize-tcp-performance.md)

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required criteria for Microsoft 365.
