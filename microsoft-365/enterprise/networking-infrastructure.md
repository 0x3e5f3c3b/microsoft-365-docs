# Phase 1: Networking infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Office 365 and Windows Intune as part of Enterprise Management + Security (EMS). Both of these cloud-based services rely on the security, performance, and reliability of connections from client devices over the Internet or dedicated circuits. Microsoft has designed the network that hosts these services and its connections to the Internet to enable customers all over the world to connect in a performant way.

In this phase, you step through the key considerations for creating a performant connection to the cloud services of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. For an overview, see [Office 365 networking principles](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Getting-the-best-connectivity-and-performance-in-Office-365/ba-p/124694).

>If you already have a networking infrastructure deployed, please see the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise networking infrastructure 

Use the following steps to build out your networking infrastructure for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

- [Step 1: Check your Internet bandwidth](networking-provide-bandwidth-cloud-services.md)
- [Step 2: Ensure that DNS resolution is is local to the ISP](networking-dns-resolution-same-location.md)
- [Step 3: Configure your proxy servers and firewalls](networking-configure-proxies-firewalls.md)
- [Step 4: Plan for URL and IP address changes](networking-implement-endpoint-change-mgmt.md)
- [Step 5: Optimize client and Office 365 service performance](networking-optimize-tcp-performance.md)

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required and optional conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
