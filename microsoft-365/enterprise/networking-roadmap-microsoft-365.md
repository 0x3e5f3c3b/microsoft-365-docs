# Networking roadmap for Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Office 365, Microsoft Intune, and many identity and security services of Microsoft Azure. All of these cloud-based services rely on the security, performance, and reliability of connections from client devices over the Internet or dedicated circuits. To host these services and make them available to customers all over the world, Microsoft has designed a networking infrastructure that emphasizes performance and integration. 

In this phase, you step through the key considerations for creating a performant connection to the cloud services of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. For an overview, see [Microsoft 365 networking principles](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Getting-the-best-connectivity-and-performance-in-Office-365/ba-p/124694).
