# Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Office 365 ProPlus, the subscription version of Office that includes all the Office applications, installed directly on your client devices. Unlike Office 2016, Office 365 ProPlus is updated with new features on a regular basis, as often as monthly. Office 365 ProPlus also has a user-based licensing model that allows people to install Office on up to 5 PCs or Macs and on their mobile devices. For more details, see [About Office 365 ProPlus in the enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/about-office-365-proplus-in-the-enterprise).

In this phase, you deploy Office 365 ProPlus to client devices as part of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. In addition to this guidance, we recommend you use [Microsoft Fastrack](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office) to help with your deployment. 

>[!Note]
>If you already have Office 365 ProPlus deployed, please see the [exit criteria](office365proplus-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to make sure that it meets the required conditions for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

## Step 1: Assess your environment

Before deploying Office 365 ProPlus, follow the guidance in [Assess your environment and requirements for deploying Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/assess-office-365-proplus). That assessment includes system requirements, details of your client devices (such as architectures and  required languages), licensing requirements, network capability, and application compatibility. Completing the assessment will help you make key decisions as part of planning your deployment.

## Step 2: Plan your deployment

After assessing your environment, follow the guidance in  [Plan your deployment of Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/plan-office-365-proplus) to create a deployment plan. This plan includes the following decisions: 

- How to deploy Office, including what tool to use (such as System Center Configuration Manger or the Office Deployment Tool) and where to install Office from
- How to manage updates to Office
- Which update channels to use, which controls how frequently your users receive feature updates to their Office applications
- The Office installation packages and deployment groups you want to use
