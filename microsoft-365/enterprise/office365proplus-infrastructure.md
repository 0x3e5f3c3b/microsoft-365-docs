# Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise

This phase of the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Deployment guidance walks you through planning and deploying Office 365 ProPlus client applications as part of your Microsoft 365 implementation. The Office 365 ProPlus client application deployment that you complete in this phase relies on the Microsoft 365 Enterprise infrastructure and the configurations that you deployed in previous phases. 

Be sure that you have successfully met the exit criteria for all the previous phases before you begin planning and deploying Office 365 ProPlus client applications.

More than likely, you will be deploying the Office 365 ProPlus client applications to a variety of types of devices in your organization; laptops, desktops, and a combination of company-provided personal mobile devices. Some users of these devices will have administrative access to them and some will not. 

The quality of network connectivity between the devices and the distribution source will vary and the frequency at which you want those devices to receive feature updates depends on the job role of the user and their business needs. 

Finally, it is likely that you already have multiple tools and procedures for distributing and maintaining software in your environment.

This phase of the Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guidance provides you with five different Office 365 ProPlus deployment methods that you can use. You may end up using one, some, or all of them depending on your environment, business needs, and the tools you have available.

If you already have Office 365 ProPlus deployed, please see the [Exit criteria](office365proplus-exit-criteria.md) to make sure that your Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure meets the requirements for Microsoft 365 Enterprise. 

## Plan and deploy your Microsoft 365 Enterprise Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure 

Use the following steps to build out your new Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure or to adapt your existing infrastructure for the requirements and capabilities of Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

See the following steps to deploy Office 365 ProPlus for Microsoft 365 Enterprise: 

- [Step 1: Perform a technical inventory and environmental assessment for your business requirements](office365proplus-perform-techinventory-envassess-busrequirements.md)
- [Step 2 : Classify the target devices into deployment groups](office365proplus-classify-target-devices-deployment-groups.md)
- [Step 3 : Match deployment methods to groups](office365proplus-match-deployment-methods-groups.md)
- [Step 4: Deploy Office 365 ProPlus](office365proplus-deploy-office365-proplus.md)

When have completed these steps, go to the [exit criteria](office365proplus-exit-criteria.md) for this phase to ensure that you meet the required configuration for Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
