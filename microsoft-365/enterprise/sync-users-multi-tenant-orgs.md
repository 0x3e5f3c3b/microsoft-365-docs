# Sync users in multi-tenant orgs in Microsoft 365 (Preview)


Set up outbound directory sync from your tenant to other active tenants in this multitenant organization. Once you Share users, the selected users will sync to all active tenants in this organization. Upon completion, users in other active tenants will be able to search and discover the user profiles shared by your tenant.

Select the users and groups of users you want to share with the active tenants in your multitenant organization. Note: Groups will not be synced to target, only the users within the groups will be synced. Also, changes to your outbound sync settings here will reflect in Azure Active Directory too.


1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand **Settings**.
1. Select **Org settings**.
1. On the **Organization profile** tab, select **Multitenant collaboration**.
