# Tenant roadmap for Microsoft 365

Your Microsoft 365 tenant is the set of services assigned to your organization. This tenant is typically associated with one or more of your DNS domain names and acts as a central container for different subscriptions and the licenses within them that you assign to user accounts. When you create a Microsoft 365 tenant, you assign it to a specific geograhical location. You can also have a tenant with multiple geographical locations and move your tenant from one location to another.

A well-planned and executed tenant configuration is critical to getting it ready for the foundational services of networking and identity.

## Plan

In the planning phase of your tenant implementation:

- Understand the subscriptions, licenses, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants for an organization tenant
- Understand how to use third-party SSL certificates
- Access setup guides in the Microsoft 365 admin center
- Understand the ways a Microsoft 365 tenant is integrated with Azure AD services
- Plan for client app support
- Determine how to use hybrid modern authentication
- Plan for Office 2007 and Office 2013 upgrades
- Understand tenant isolation
- Get the details on Microsoft 365 service assurance

## Deploy

In the deployment phase of your tenant implementation, add the DNS domains for your organization.

## Tenants with multiple geographic locations

With Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo, your organization can expand its Microsoft 365 presence to multiple geographic regions and/or countries within your existing tenant.

Get started in understanding, planning, configuring, and then administering with Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo.

## Moving a tenant's geographic locations

Microsoft continues to open new datacenter geographic locations (geos) for Microsoft 365 services. These new datacenter geos add capacity and compute resources to support customer demand and usage growth. Additionally, the new datacenter geos offer in-geo data residency for core customer data.

Get started in understanding and requesing a geo data move with Moving core data to new Microsoft 365 datacenter geos.

## Next step

Start your tenant planning with Subscriptions, licenses, and tenants.
