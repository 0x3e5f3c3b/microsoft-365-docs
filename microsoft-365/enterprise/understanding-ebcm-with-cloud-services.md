# Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) with cloud services

You probably already have business continuity plans in place for the IT services and infrastructure you support internally. You've taken the facilities and environmental, physical security, network connectivity, storage and compute hardware and data availability all into account. Now, as your digital transformation proceeds to include Microsoft 365 cloud services, some of your critical business processes include cloud components and depend on those cloud services being available.
If you haven't revisited and updated your business continuity plans for the cloud services that you depend on, this series of topics helps you through understanding the considerations that are introduced into your EBCM planning by having cloud service dependencies.

Your organization should already have a continuity strategy for your on-premises environment,
at minimum. When your organization onboards to M365, we recommend performing these
steps to adjust your strategy for processes now depending on Exchange Online, SharePoint
Online, OneDrive for Business, and others. Remember to include in your analysis any onpremises infrastructure relevant to M365, such as ADFS

As part of your digital transformation, you need to revisit and update your disaster recovery/business continuity plan to account for the business process that now include M365 Cloud components.

## Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guide

The Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guide steps you through the correct and required configuration of Microsoft 365 Enterprise products and features.

To deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise yourself, you can:

- Deploy the [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) for built-in security and integration for simplified management, which makes it easier to ensure your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements. 
 
  The foundation infrastructure is organized as a series of numbered phases that build upon each other and towards an environment that supports Microsoft 365 Enterprise workloads and scenarios. 

  **If you are a smaller or newer organization**, follow the phases in order to methodically build out your infrastructure.

  However, you can deploy phases or the portions of phases of this infrastructure in any order as needed, [one after the other or in parallel](deployment-strategies-microsoft-365-enterprise.md), to integrate with your current infrastructure, fit your IT plans and resources, and meet your business needs. 

  **If you are an enterprise organization**, view the phases as layers of IT infrastructure, rather than a defined path, and determine how to best work toward eventual adherence to the requirements of each layer across your organization.

- Deploy key productivity [workloads and scenarios](deploy-workloads.md) on top of your infrastructure. These unlock creativity and teamwork in your organization.

Here's the relationship between the foundation infrastructure and the workloads and scenarios.

Workloads and scenarios operate over the top of the foundation infrastructure. However, you do not have to have all of the foundation infrastructure phases built out to begin using workloads for productivity and collaboration.

## Take a test drive

“*For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.*” - Aristotle

If you're new to Microsoft 365 Enterprise or to a specific product or feature, one of the best ways to gain understanding is to build it out yourself and see it working.

We've made this easier with Test Lab Guides (TLGs), which step you through the configuration of infrastructure or a feature in a simplified but representative environment using trial or paid subscriptions.

With TLGs, you can self-learn, demonstrate, customize, or build a proof of concept of a complex configuration, workload, or end-to-end scenario.

For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides](m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides.md).

### How Microsoft uses Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Defining a digital culture is a major priority for every leader who strives to foster a modern workplace. Microsoft 365 was designed to support this kind of cultural shift, helping leaders empower everyone at their companies to unleash creativity and collaboration. At Microsoft, establishing our foundational infrastructure has sparked precisely this kind of digital culture shift. Implementing Microsoft 365 Enterprise has allowed us to deploy collaboration technology, like Microsoft Teams and Exchange Online, and to share sensitive data online across secure SharePoint intranet sites.

At the same time, intelligent security features and product integration helps streamline management needs and minimize the total cost of ownership across the IT lifecycle. 

Learn how Core Services Engineering and Operations (formerly Microsoft IT) [planned and deployed a foundation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/deploying-and-managing-microsoft-365) to support the applications and services that unlock creativity and foster teamwork in a secure environment.
