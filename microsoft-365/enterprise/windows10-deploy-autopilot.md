# Configure and deploy Windows 10 Enterprise with Windows AutoPilot

Follow this guide to configure and deploy a Windows 10 Enterprise using Windows AutoPilot&mdash;a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new devices, getting them ready for productive use. To learn more about Windows AutoPilot, including benefits and scenarios, see [Overview of Windows AutoPilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-10-autopilot).

## Step 1: Consideration phase
This guide makes several assumptions regarding essential, business-critical considerations before upgrading an OS in an enterprise environment.

**Requirements**

Make sure you have the following requirements deployed and licensed.

| Product | License |
|---|---|
| Microsoft Intune | E3, E5, or Intune standalone |
| Azure AD Premium | E3 or E5 |
| Office 365 ProPlus | Business Premium, E3, E5, or Office 365 ProPlus standalone |

Before upgrading an OS in an enterprise environment, take the following technical aspects into account:
* [Infrastructure](#11-infrastructure)
* [Apps](#12-apps)
* [Governance and business processes](#13-governance-and-business-processes)

This guide is meant only to provide Microsoft's best recommendations around these assumptions by providing links to existing documentation.

### 1.1 Infrastructure

#### Group Policy
With Windows AutoPilot, a device automatically joins their organization’s Azure AD group once a user signs into their organization from the device. The Group Policy policies (along with other customized settings and apps) are automatically pushed to the new device. It’s critical to understand that these policies must be properly configured within an organization before setting up Windows AutoPilot profiles.

Windows 10 introduces many new features and removes and changes many others in Windows 7 and 8.1, including new Group Policy settings which need to be tested and implemented as part of a Windows 10 migration. The following resources provide examples on assessing current group policies for Windows, including Group Policy Objects in the Active Directory structure:
* [Manage Windows 10 with administrative templates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860226)
* [Group Policy settings that apply to Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/group-policies-for-enterprise-and-education-editions)

#### Data management
Be sure to back up user data if necessary. Because of the out-of-box experience (OOBE), user data isn't saved on a net-new computer. We recommend configuring a backup scenario as needed. For example, export all user data to a OneDrive for Business account, BitLocker To Go-encrypted USB flash drive, or network file server. For more info, see:
* [How to back up or transfer your data on a Windows-based computer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860230)
* [Redirect known folders to OneDrive for Business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846620)

### 1.2 Apps

#### Security
Security clients (like antivirus, anti-malware, and anti-spam) are typically found on all PCs within an organization. Because these programs hook into the deeper levels of the OS, you may need to perform a compatibility assessment before starting any Windows 10 migrations. You may need to upgrade, reconfigure, or even replace Some software. Not performing this assessment can lead to:
* Native app compatibility checks failing and preventing an in-place upgrade from starting.
* Broken functionality in the security software.
* Instability after upgrading to Windows 10 (like crashing and reduced performance)

We recommend using Windows Defender Antivirus and Windows Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). For more info, see [Enable Windows 10 Enterprise security features](windows10-enable-security-features.md)

**Antivirus**

Assess current antivirus software. Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender Antivirus to protect devices from malware, viruses, and security threats. We recommend Windows Defender Antivirus. To enable Windows Defender Antivirus, see [Windows Defender Antivirus](windows10-enable-security-features.md#windows-defender-antivirus) and [Protect devices with Windows Defender Antivirus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860254).

To learn about antivirus solutions from other providers, see [Consumer antivirus software providers for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=67345).

#### App readiness
Each Windows 10 release provides improved app compatibility. However, some apps may not be compatible. Depending on the app, you may need to only do a simple upgrade or configuration update before upgrading to Windows 10. In other circumstances, you may need to remove an app entirely.

Be sure to assess business critical apps and understand the impact of upgrading to the next OS. Prioritize the workloads that impact the least number of people during deployment. 

See the following Upgrade Readiness resources to help with app inventory, driver compatibility issues, and usage information:
* [Manage Windows Upgrades with Upgrade Readiness](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860255)
* [Configure Windows telemetry](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859970)

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrade Readiness may not be able to assess compatibility for custom and line-of-business (LOB) apps in an organization.

#### Language packs
For a Microsoft 365 powered device, you'll also need to download Office 365 ProPlus language packs that applies to the client. These come in 32-bit (x86) or 65-bit (x64). A specific language must be installed as the default. You can install other languages later. For more info, see:
* [Choose between 65-bit or 32-bit version of Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862361)
* [Language accessory pack for Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860280)
* [Add an additional language pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860281)

### 1.3 Governance and business processes

#### Windows as a service
Windows 10 introduced the concept of Windows as a service. This greatly changes the frequency and style of updates to Windows. Instead of new versions being released every 3-5 years, a more incremental model is used where two smaller updates (Feature Updates) are released yearly. For more info, see:
* [Overview of Windows as a service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860288)
* [Update Windows 10 in the enterprise](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860285)

#### Pilot users and deployment rings
Be sure to have a pilot group of users selected from different parts of the business. If you have Microsoft 365 powered devices, Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus users should be in these deployment rings. You need to create deployment groups to help minimize the effect on network bandwidth.

**Windows 10 deployment rings**

There are three servicing channels for OS deployment rings:
* Windows Insider Program - Provides organizations with the opportunity to test and provide feedback on features that are shipped in the next feature update.
* Semi-Annual Channel - Provides new functionality with twice-per-year feature update releases. Organizations can choose when to deploy updates from the Semi-Annual Channel.
* Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) - Used for specialized devices and receives new feature releases about every three years.

For more info, see:
* [Windows Insider Program, Semi-Annual Channel, and Long-Term Servicing Channel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860293)
* [Build deployment rings for Windows 10 updates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860294)
* [Manage software updates using Intune in Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-update-for-business-configure)

**Office 365 ProPlus**

For Microsoft 365 powered devices, you must also be able to support the six-month update channel for both IT and business users. One way to do so is to have three groups:
* Current Channel
* Deferred Channel
* First-release for Deferred Channel

Each group has different configuration files, as users from the Current Channel are used as a pilot to test earlier updates. For more info, see:
* [Update process for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860299)
* [Manage updates to Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860300)
* [Configure update settings for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860301)
* [Update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860302)
* [Version and build numbers of update channel releases](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860304)

For more info, see [Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise](office365proplus-infrastructure.md).

## Step 2: Testing phase
Once you've completed the scenarios and requirements in [Step 1: Consideration phase](#step-1-consideration-phase), you can move to this stage. 

To use Windows AutoPilot, make sure you are ready to perform these tasks:
* [Networking](#21-networking)
* [Identity](#22-identity)
* [Client readiness](#23-client-readiness)
* [Telemetry](#24-telemetry)

### 2.1 Networking
Ports to the client need to be opened for Office 365 ProPlus (for a Microsoft 365 powered device) and Configuration Manager. For more details about setting up your Microsoft 365 Enterprise networking infrastructure, see [Phase 1: Networking](networking-infrastructure.md).

When setting up your networking infrastructure as part of Windows deployment, make sure you complete these steps:
1. Read the best practices for [network planning and improving migration performance for Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733655).
2. [Plan for network devices that connect to Office 365 services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733652).
3. [Review network impact of directory synchronization](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733652).
4. Calculate the number of clients to use per IP address and understand [Network Address Translation (NAT) support with Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733653) and how it impacts the number of users and client devices you can serve with a single IP address.
5. If your organization restricts computers on your network from connecting to the Internet, you'll need to understand the [endpoints (fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), ports, URLs, IPv4, and IPv6 address ranges)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=280129) that you should include in your outbound allow lists to ensure your computers can successfully use Office 365 services.
6. [Create domain name system records for Office 365 at any Domain Name System hosting provider](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733656).
7. [Reduce mail exchange (MX) DNS record time to live (TTL) value](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733656).

### 2.2 Identity
Intelligent security for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, in which the right users have access to the right resources with an appropriate level of access, begins with identity management. For more details about setting up your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure, see [Phase 2: Identity](identity-infrastructure.md).

When setting up your identity infrastructure as part of Windows deployment, make sure you complete these tasks:
1. [Add a domain and users to Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526338).
2. [Install and run the Office 365 IdFix tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733662), which scans your on-premises Active Directory environment and identifies problems that might impact directory synchronization and slow your migration to Office 365.
3. Configure Active Directory for directory synchronization with Office 365 and [integrate on-premises directories with Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733661).
4. [Prepare to provision users through directory synchronization to Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733659).
5. Know the [prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733663), then install and run the Azure AD Connect tool to synchronize your on-premises Active Directory to the Azure AD service used by Office 365.
6. Determine custom installation of Azure AD Connect (full version of SQL Server for directory synchronization, if required).
7. [Integrate your on-premises identities with Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733485).
8. [Sync a list of required attributes with AD Connect](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860363) to get all the features in Office 365 and Windows 10.
9. Activate Windows 10 Enterprise licenses, which are checked based on Azure AD credentials.

    This provides a systematic way to assign licenses to end users and groups in your organization. For more info, see [Windows 10 Subscription Activation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860365) and [Deploy Windows 10 licenses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860367).

### 2.3 Client readiness

#### System requirements
To prepare for Windows 10 deployment through Windows AutoPilot, make sure you meet these system requirements:
* Windows 10, version 1703 or later
* Intune licenses other mobile device management (MDM) services to manage devices
* Storage and bandwith requires minimal customization
* Telemetry (set at Basic level or above) - For more info, see [2.4 Telemetry](#24-telemetry).
* Windows 10 Enterprise E3 or E5
* Devices must be registered to your organization - For more info, see [Plan for network devices that connect to Office 365 services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733652).
* Devices must be pre-installed with Windows 10, version 1703 or later
* Devices must have access to the Internet
* Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 is installed and configured and [automatic enrollment must be configured](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860700)

### 2.4 Telemetry
Microsoft uses telemetry data to help keep Windows devices secure by identifying malware trends and other threats and to help us improve the quality of Windows and Microsoft services. You must ensure that the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled at a minimum level of Basic on all endpoints in you organization. **By default, this service is enabled and set to the Enhanced level.** However, it’s good practice to check and ensure that they are receiving sensor data. Setting levels through policies overrides device-level settings. For more info, see:
* [Ensure telemetry is enabled on all endpoints](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859970)
* [Use Intune to set the telemetry level](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860460)
