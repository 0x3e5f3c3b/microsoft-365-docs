# Configure and deploy Windows 10 Enterprise as an in-place upgrade

Follow this guide to configure and deploy a Windows 10 Enterprise image using System Center Configuration Manager (Configuration Manager) as an in-place upgrade.

## Step 1: Consideration phase
Before upgrading an OS in an enterprise environment, take the following technical aspects into account:
* [Infrastructure](#11-infrastructure)
* [Apps](#12-apps)
* [Governance and business processes](#13-governance-and-business-processes)

This guide is meant only to provide Microsoft's best recommendations around these assumptions by providing links to existing documentation.

### 1.1 Infrastructure

#### Group Policy
Windows 10 introduces many new features and removes and changes many others in Windows 7 and 8.1, including new Group Policy settings which need to be tested and implemented as part of a Windows 10 migration. The following resources provide examples on assessing current group policies for Windows, including Group Policy Objects in the Active Directory structure:
* [Manage Windows 10 with administrative templates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860226)
* [Group Policy settings that apply to Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/group-policies-for-enterprise-and-education-editions)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are considering moving to modern management by using MDM instead of Group Policy to manage device configurations, you can start by using the MDM Migration Analysis Tool (MMAT) to determine what Group Policies are set on the device and report the corresponding settings, if available.

#### Data management
Although in-place upgrades shouldn’t affect user data and apps, a best practice is to configure a backup scenario and back up user data. For example, export all user data to a OneDrive for Business account, BitLocker To Go-encrypted USB flash drive, or network file server. For more details, see:
* [How to back up or transfer your data on a Windows-based computer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860230)
* [Redirect known folders to OneDrive for Business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846620)

#### System Center Configuration Manager
This guide assumes you are following Microsoft recommendations and have one of the following versions of System Center Configuration Manager 2012 onward:
* System Center 2012 Configuration Manager with SP2
* System Center 2012, 2012 R2 Configuration Manager with SP1, Current Branch, 1706
    * [Run an in-place upgrade to the latest Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839406)
    * [Updates for Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=620343)
* Core Configuration Manager configuration
    * CONFIGURATION MANAGER accounts
    * Active Directory permissions
    * Source folder structure
    * Active Directory schema
* Configure the following [necessary Configuration Manager components for Windows 10 deployment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860245):
    * State migration point - Stores user state migration data during computer replace scenarios
    * Distribution point - Stores all packages in Configuration Manager
    * Software update point - Updates an OS as part of the deployment process
    * Reporting services point - Monitors the OS deployment process
    * Boot images - Windows Preinstallation Environment (PE) images Configuration Manager uses to start deployments
    * OS images - The production deployment image (mounted OS)
    * OS installers - Creates reference images using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) Light Touch
    * Drivers - A repository of managed device drivers
    * Task Sequence - Delivered automatically to the client as a policy

#### Network bandwidth
This guide assumes you have enough network bandwidth to support the deployment of Windows 10 Enterprise and Office 365 ProPlus as a unit. As a bundle, network bandwidth is a significant factor.

#### Client machines and in-place upgrade scenario
* Disk encryption - Third-party disk encryption isn't supported in an in-place upgrade scenario.
* User profiles - Only the standard user profile type is supported.
* Legacy BIOS to Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) booting - Changing from legacy BIOS to UEFI booting isn't supported.
* Dual-boot - This scenario is not covered in the guide. If you have the FastTrack Benefit, it only covers devices running a single OS.
* Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environments - This scenario is not covered in the guide. If you have the FastTrack Benefit, it doesn't cover configuration or deployment on VDI environments.
* x64 and x86 - Changing from a 32-bit OS to a 64-bit isn't supported. For more info, see [Windows 10 deployment scenario > In-place upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-10-deployment-scenarios#in-place-upgrade).

### 1.2 Apps

#### Security
Security clients (like antivirus, anti-malware, and anti-spam) are typically found on all PCs within an organization. Because these programs hook into the deeper levels of the OS, you may need to perform a compatibility assessment before starting any Windows 10 migrations. You may need to upgrade, reconfigure, or even replace Some software. Not performing this assessment can lead to:
* Native app compatibility checks failing and preventing an in-place upgrade from starting.
* Broken functionality in the security software.
* Instability after upgrading to Windows 10 (like crashing and reduced performance)

**Antivirus**

Assess current antivirus software. Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender Antivirus to protect devices from malware, viruses, and security threats. We recommend Windows Defender Antivirus. To enable Windows Defender Antivirus, see [Windows Defender Antivirus](windows10-enable-security-features.md#windows-defender-antivirus) and [Protect devices with Windows Defender Antivirus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860254).

To learn about antivirus solutions from other providers, see [Consumer antivirus software providers for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=67345).

#### App readiness
Each Windows 10 release provides improved app compatibility. However, some apps may not be compatible. Depending on the app, you may need to only do a simple upgrade or configuration update before upgrading to Windows 10. In other circumstances, you may need to remove an app entirely.

Be sure to assess business critical apps and understand the impact of upgrading to the next OS. Prioritize the workloads that impact the least number of people during deployment. 

See the following Upgrade Readiness resources to help with app inventory, driver compatibility issues, and usage information:
* [Manage Windows Upgrades with Upgrade Readiness](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860255)
* [Configure Windows telemetry](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859970)

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrade Readiness may not be able to assess compatibility for custom and line-of-business (LOB) apps in an organization.

#### Language packs
In-place upgrades have have limitations when it comes to language packs. The language stays consistent throughout the upgrade. Verify the language version and make sure it stays consistent. For example, Windows 7 with English as the default won’t change when upgraded to Windows 10. For more info, see:
* [Default language pack on your OS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860282)
* [Finding language packs on each Widnows 10 deployment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860283)

For a Microsoft 365 powered device, you'll also need to download Office 365 ProPlus language packs that applies to the client. These come in 32-bit (x86) or 65-bit (x64). A specific language must be installed as the default. You can install other languages later. For more info, see:
* [Choose between 65-bit or 32-bit version of Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862361)
* [Language accessory pack for Office](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860280)
* [Add an additional language pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860281)

### 1.3 Governance and business processes

#### Windows as a service
Windows 10 introduced the concept of Windows as a service. This greatly changes the frequency and style of updates to Windows. Instead of new versions being released every 3-5 years, a more incremental model is used where two smaller updates (Feature Updates) are released yearly. For more info, see:
* [Overview of Windows as a service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860288)
* [Update Windows 10 in the enterprise](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860285)

#### Pilot users and deployment rings
Be sure to have a pilot group of users selected from different parts of the business. If you have Microsoft 365 powered devices, Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus users should be in these deployment rings. This affects future Windows updates as well (including features and quality). You need to create and edit device collections by deployment rings to help minimize the effect on network bandwidth and simplify future updates. 

For the group of pilot users, create a device collection on Configuration Manager. The list of devices should correspond to the list of the first users upgraded to Windows 10. 

**Windows 10 deployment rings**

There are three servicing channels for OS deployment rings:
* Windows Insider Program - Provides organizations with the opportunity to test and provide feedback on features that are shipped in the next feature update.
* Semi-Annual Channel - Provides new functionality with twice-per-year feature update releases. Organizations can choose when to deploy updates from the Semi-Annual Channel.
* Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) - Used for specialized devices and receives new feature releases about every three years.

For more info, see:
* [Windows Insider Program, Semi-Annual Channel, and Long-Term Servicing Channel](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860293)
* [Build deployment rings for Windows 10 updates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860294)
* [Manage software updates using Intune in Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-update-for-business-configure)

**Office 365 ProPlus**

For Microsoft 365 powered devices, you must also be able to support the six-month update channel for both IT and business users. One way to do so is to have three groups:
* Current Channel
* Deferred Channel
* First-release for Deferred Channel

Each group has different configuration files, as users from the Current Channel are used as a pilot to test earlier updates. For more info, see:
* [Update process for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860299)
* [Manage updates to Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860300)
* [Configure update settings for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860301)
* [Update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860302)
* [Version and build numbers of update channel releases](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860304)

For more info, see [Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise](office365proplus-infrastructure.md).

## Step 2: Testing phase
Once you've completed the scenarios and requirements in [Step 1: Consideration phase](#step-1-consideration-phase), you can move to this stage.
* [Networking](#21-networking)
* [Identity](#22-identity)
* [Client readiness](#23-client-readiness)
* [System Center Configuration Manager](#24-system-center-configuration-manager)
* [Telemetry](#25-telemetry)

### 2.1 Networking
Ports to the client need to be opened for Office 365 ProPlus (for a Microsoft 365 powered device) and Configuration Manager. For more details about setting up your Microsoft 365 Enterprise networking infrastructure, see [Phase 1: Networking](networking-infrastructure.md).

When setting up your networking infrastructure as part your in-place upgrade, make sure you complete these steps:
1. Read the best practices for [network planning and improving migration performance for Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733655).
2. [Plan for network devices that connect to Office 365 services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733652).
3. [Review network impact of directory synchronization](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733652).
4. Calculate the number of clients to use per IP address and understand [Network Address Translation (NAT) support with Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733653) and how it impacts the number of users and client devices you can serve with a single IP address.
5. If your organization restricts computers on your network from connecting to the Internet, you'll need to understand the [endpoints (fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), ports, URLs, IPv4, and IPv6 address ranges)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=280129) that you should include in your outbound allow lists to ensure your computers can successfully use Office 365 services.
6. [Create domain name system records for Office 365 at any Domain Name System hosting provider](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733656).
7. [Reduce mail exchange (MX) DNS record time to live (TTL) value](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733656).

### 2.2 Identity
Intelligent security for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, in which the right users have access to the right resources with an appropriate level of access, begins with identity management. For more details about setting up your Microsoft 365 Enterprise identity infrastructure, see [Phase 2: Identity](identity-infrastructure.md).

When setting up your identity infrastructure as part of your in-place upgrade, make sure you complete these tasks:
1. [Add a domain and users to Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526338).
2. [Install and run the Office 365 IdFix tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733662), which scans your on-premises Active Directory environment and identifies problems that might impact directory synchronization and slow your migration to Office 365.
3. Configure Active Directory for directory synchronization with Office 365 and [integrate on-premises directories with Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733661).
4. [Prepare to provision users through directory synchronization to Office 365](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733659).
5. Know the [prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733663), then install and run the Azure AD Connect tool to synchronize your on-premises Active Directory to the Azure AD service used by Office 365.
6. Determine custom installation of Azure AD Connect (full version of SQL Server for directory synchronization, if required).
7. [Integrate your on-premises identities with Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733485).
8. [Sync a list of required attributes with AD Connect](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860363) to get all the features in Office 365 and Windows 10.
9. Activate Windows 10 Enterprise licenses, which are checked based on Azure AD credentials.

    This provides a systematic way to assign licenses to end users and groups in your organization. For more info, see [Windows 10 Subscription Activation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860365) and [Deploy Windows 10 licenses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860367).

### 2.3 Client readiness

#### System requirements for Office 365
Confirm that Windows 10 works with Office 365. Be sure you're using the latest OS version and browsers with Office 365 and have updated them with the latest service packs. For more info on Office requirements, see [System requirements for Office](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394412).

### 2.4 System Center Configuration Manager
See [System Center Configuration Manager](#system-center-configuration-manager).

### 2.5 Telemetry
Microsoft uses telemetry data to help keep Windows devices secure by identifying malware trends and other threats and to help us improve the quality of Windows and Microsoft services. You must ensure that the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled at a minimum level of Basic on all endpoints in your organization. **By default, this service is enabled and set to the Enhanced level.** However, it’s good practice to check and ensure that they are receiving sensor data. Setting levels through policies overrides device-level settings. For more info, see:
* [Ensure telemetry is enabled on all endpoints](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859970)
* [Use Intune to set the telemetry level](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860460)

## Step 3: Deployment phase
When ready, complete these:
* [In-place upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise](#31-in-place-upgrade-to-windows-10-enterprise)
* [Windows Defender Antivirus](#32-windows-defender-antivirus)

### 3.1 In-place upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise
1. Integrate System Center Configuration Manager with Microsoft Deployment Tool.

    Be sure to use the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) in conjunction with Configuration Manager when deploying an updated version of Windows 10. MDT brings Zero Touch Installation and Light Touch Installation enhancements to help with deployments at no cost to the customer. For more info, see:
    * [Download the latest MDT](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860465)
    * [Deploy Windows 10 with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860466)

2. Prepare for zero touch installation.

    As part of zero touch installation, you are responsible for preparing the following:
    * Configuration Manager service accounts
    * Active Directory pernmissions
    * Source folder structure

    Then, [integrate Configuration Manager with MDT](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860035).

3. Create a custom Windows Preinstallation Environment boot image.

    Windows Preinstallation Environment (PE) is a pre-installation environment required for OS deployments. It’s used to prepare a client machine for Windows installation, to copy disk images from a network file server, and to initiate Windows Setup. It’s used for Windows 10 Enterprise editions. For more info, see:
    * [Overview of Windows PE](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860468)
    * [Windows PE features, hardware requirements, and limitations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860469)
    * [Create a custom Windows PE boot image with Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860470)

4. Add a Windows 10 OS upgrade image.

    You need to create a Windows 10 reference image with MDT (as needed). Reference images are the foundation of what each of the client machine’s OS looks like. The image should be in a separate folder located with the already-mounted ISO file. The task sequence looks for and then runs “setup.exe”. 

    Follow the steps to create and add a Windows 10 OS upgrade image on Configuration Manager:
    * [Create a Windows 10 reference image](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860500)
    * [Add a Windows 10 OS image using Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860501)

5. Create an app to deploy with Windows 10.

    For a Microsoft 365 powered device, you can deploy Office 365 ProPlus with Windows 10 Enterprise using Configuration Manager. You can also add other apps as needed.

    To deploy Office 365 ProPlus, follow the steps in [Phase 4: Office 365 ProPlus infrastructure for Microsoft 365 Enterprise](office365proplus-infrastructure.md). During this phase, make sure you complete these steps:
    
    1. Download the Office 2016 Deployment Tool (ODT) in conjunction with Configuration Manager to help with Office 365 ProPlus deployments. 
    2. Edit the configuration XML file to fit specific deployment needs (like version, language, and product element). 
    
    You can then create apps with Configuration Manager. For more info, see:
    * [Configuration options for ODT](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860504)
    * [Create apps in Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=761079)
    * [Deploy Office 365 ProPlus with Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860506)

6. Add drivers to a Windows 10 deployment using Windows PE.

    Network drivers need to be created for both Windows PE and Windows 10 to connect deployment shares and storage drivers with local storage on a client computer. Use Configuration Manager to create these drivers required for deployment. For more info, see [Add drivers to a Windows 10 deployment with Windows PE using Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860036).

7. Create a task sequence.

    A task sequence (a collection of commands) is required for MDT Lite Touch Installation (LTI). You need to create and then edit the task sequence for optimal deployment experience. One of the configurations enable support for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The UEFI environment is a minimal boot OS where devices are booted and the Windows 10 OS runs. For more info, see:
    * [Overview of Windows Boot Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860696)
    * [Create the task sequence in Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860697)

8. Finalize the OS configuration for Windows 10 deployment.

    **To finalize the OS configuration**

    1. Enable MDT monitoring
    2. Create and share the Logs folder
    3. Configure the rules
    4. Distribute content to the distribution point (a server running Configuration Manager)
    5. Create a deployment for the task sequence

   For more info, see [Finalize OS configuration with Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860697).

9. Deploy the Windows 10 Enterprise image to a UEFI machine.

    For more info, see [Deploy Windows 10 using Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860697).

10. Monitor the Windows 10 deployment.

    Use Configuration Manager and MDT to monitor your deployment. Deployment Workbench enables access to the computer remotely using the Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) (optional). Deployments can be monitored in Configuration Manager. For more info, see [Monitor the Windows 10 deployment with Configuration Manager](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860705).
