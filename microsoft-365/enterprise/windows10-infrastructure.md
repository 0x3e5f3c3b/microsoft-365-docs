# Phase 3: Windows 10 Enterprise

## Deployment
There are multiple ways you can deploy Windows 10 Enterprise for your organization. Here, we'll focus on how you can configure and deploy a Windows 10 Enterprise image through these modern deployment scenarios:
* [Using System Center Configuration Manager as an in-place upgrade](windows10-deploy-inplaceupgrade.md) - Use this if you use Windows Setup to update your OS and migrate apps and settings. Rollback data is saved in Windows.old.
* [Using Windows AutoPilot](windows10-deploy-autopilot.md) - Use this to customize the out-of-box-experience (OOBE) for your organization, and deploy a new system with apps and settings already configured. 

To learn all about these, and other, scenarios and understand the capabilities and limitations of each, see [Windows 10 deployment scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-deployment-scenarios).

## Security
Windows 10 provides features to help protect against threats, help you secure your devices, and help with access control. With Windows 10, you get critical security features that protect your device right from the start. Microsoft 365 E3 adds security features such as Windows Hello for Business, Windows Defender Application Control, and Windows Information Protection. With Microsoft 365 E5, you get all the protection from Microsoft 365 E3 security plus cloud-based security features and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. 

To learn more about the security features that you get with Windows 10 Enterprise and get guidance on how you can deploy, manage, configure, and troubleshoot three key security features, see [Enable Windows 10 Enterprise security features](windows10-enable-security-features.md).
