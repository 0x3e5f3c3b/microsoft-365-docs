# Help your frontline workers use collaboration apps and features

Now that your organization is using Microsoft 365 for frontline workers and Microsoft Teams, you'll need to make sure your workforce is comfortable using the apps and features available to them.

Use your [corporate communications strategy](flw-corp-comms.md) to share these resources to help your frontline team make the most out of the tools available to them.

## Tags in Microsoft Teams

Using tags to start chats and in channel conversations helps your frontline workers reach the right people faster. Tags categorize people by attribute, such as role or project. Tags can be manually created, automatically assigned based on schedule information in the Shifts app or based on department or job title.
