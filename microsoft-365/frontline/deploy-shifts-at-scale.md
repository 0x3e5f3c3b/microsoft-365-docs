# Deploy Shifts to your frontline teams at scale

## Overview

## Prerequisites

- Your frontline employees must have a Microsoft 365 F3, F1, E3, or E5 license. [Learn more about frontline licensing](flw-licensing-options.md).
- Your organization’s frontline teams are created through the [deploy frontline dynamic teams](deploy-dynamic-teams-at-scale.md) experience in the Teams admin center.
- The admin running the deployment process is a Teams admin.  

## Set up Shifts for your frontline teams

1. In the left navigation of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), choose **Teams** > **Manage frontline apps**.
2. On the Manage frontline apps page, next to **Deploy Shifts to your teams** in the table, choose **Set up**.
3. Review the setup and prerequisites information, and then select **Next**.

### Configure Shifts settings

Choose the Shifts capabilities that you want to be available to your frontline teams. Capabilities include the ability to create and request open shifts, swap shifts, and offer shifts, time-off requests, and the time clock. [Learn more about Shifts settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-settings-in-shifts-1aef353d-e2df-4661-abdd-4014cb57f17b).
 
The settings you choose are applied to every team that you deploy Shifts to.

1. Under Shift requests, set the types of shift requests you want to allow:  

    - **Open shifts**: Turn on this setting to allow frontline managers to publish unfilled shifts and frontline workers to view and request those shifts.
    - **Swap shift requests**: When you turn on this setting, frontline workers can swap shifts with other employees and frontline managers can approve or reject the requests.
    - **Offer shift requests**: Turn on this setting to allow frontline workers to offer shifts to other employees and frontline managers to approve or reject the requests.
2. Choose whether to allow **Time off-requests**. When this setting is on, frontline workers can request time off and frontline managers can approve or reject the requests.  
 
    Keep in mind that if you turn off this setting, frontline managers can still assign time off to employees.  
3. Add time-off reasons.

    Under **Time-off reasons**, select **Add**, and then for each time-off reason that you create: 

    - Give it a name. It can’t be longer than 40 characters.  
    - Choose an icon.
    - Enter a unique code. The code can be up to 100 alphanumeric characters long. For example, A01.  

    Make sure the time-off reasons reflect what’s supported across your frontline organization. Frontline managers use these time-off reasons when they assign time off to frontline workers. And, if you turned on **Time-off requests**, your frontline workers choose from these time-off reasons from when they request time off.  
4. Under **Time clock**, turn on or turn off **Clock in/clock out**. When this setting is on, frontline workers can clock in and out of their shifts and record breaks, and frontline managers can export their team’s time report.  
5. When you’re done choosing your settings, select **Next**.
