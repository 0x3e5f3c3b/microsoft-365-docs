# Start with a pilot deployment of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers

Before you commit to a full rollout of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers across your organization, it's a good idea to try it out first with a small set of real people in your organization. Starting with a pilot program first can help you identify:

- Validate user readiness.
- Identify and mitigate issues.
- Help ensure a successful, organization-wide rollout.

For example, a pilot can help you determine:

- Whether the scenarios you've identified match the business needs of your organization.
- What elements will need to be modified or further customized for your organization.
- What training and orientation information you'll need to provide to users before, during, and after they start working with these new tools.

Running a pilot program is part of the overall adoption process. For more information about adopting Microsoft 365 in your organization, see:

- [Microsoft 365 Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/)
- [Microsoft 365 Adoption best practices](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/assets/M365AdoptionGuide.pdf).
- [Microsoft Teams Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/)
- [Enabling your frontline workers with Microsoft Teams](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/frontline-workers/)
- [3 ways to support frontline workers in a hybrid world](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2021/10/19/3-ways-to-support-frontline-workers-in-a-hybrid-world/)

We recommend that you prepare for deployment by completing this 30-minute learning path: [Prepare for a Teams deployment with Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/m365-teams-collab-prepare-deployment/)

## Plan your pilot

A successful pilot includes the following:

- Defined start and end dates and clearly defined goals for measuring success. These goals can help you plan the rollout after the pilot is complete. 
    - Create a test plan and process for gathering feedback, plus a communication plan.
- Allow enough time to run the pilot and assess its impact. A minimum of 30 days is recommended.
- Include the right stakeholders and participants, knowing you can add more users throughout the pilot, if necessary. For Microsoft 365 for frontline workers, make sure your stakeholders and participants include not only the business leaders and IT staff, but your frontline managers and workers, so you can both:
    - Ensure you understand their challenges while planning the implementation.
    - You can check to make sure your implementation is having a positive impact on those challenges.
- Start small and take time to pause, assess results, and adjust the pilot.

## Step 1: Set up Microsoft 365 for frontline workers and configure device support

To get ready for your rollout, here's what you need to do:

1. [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](/microsoftteams/prepare-network.md). This includes configuring your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 domain, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.
1. Purchase the appropriate licenses for the people in your pilot. Check out [Understand frontline worker user types and licensing](flw-licensing-options.md) to determine the type of licenses you'll need for your users.
1. Determine what devices you'll support. For example, you can use the Teams mobile clients on Android and iOS to provide secure access to Teams and frontline worker apps. See [devices TBD] and [Get the Teams desktop, web, and mobile clients](/microsoftteams/get-clients.md).

The Microsoft 365 admin center has a set of [Setup guides](/enterprise/setup-guides-for-microsoft-365.md) that walk you through the steps to set up the products, security features, and collaboration tools in Microsoft 365. The setup guides are accessible from the [Setup guidance page](https://aka.ms/setupguidance) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Use the [Prepare your environment](https://aka.ms/prepareyourenvironment) guide to prepare your organization's environment for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 services.
1. Use the [Microsoft 365 setup](https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide) guide to set up productivity tools, security policies, and device management capabilities. You can also use this advisor to set up and configure your organization's devices.

## Step 2: Set up email

If you are providing email for your frontline managers and workers, set it up in Microsoft Exchange Online. Your pilot users can also install the Outlook app to use for their email.

- Follow the [Email setup guide](https://aka.ms/office365setup) in the Microsoft 365 admin center to get started.

## Step 3: Set up teams and apps

1. Use [Microsoft Teams setup](https://aka.ms/teamsguidance) guide provides your organization with guidance to set up team workspaces that host real-time conversations through messaging, calls, and audio or video meetings for both team and private communication and configure guest access for those teams.
1. Configure any [policy packages](/microsoftteams/manage-policy-packages) you want to use in the Microsoft Teams admin centers. For example, you can use the Frontline Manager and Frontline Worker policy packages, or if you are in the healthcare industry, the Healthcare clinical worker policy package.
1. [Create the teams](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels) for your pilot, and make sure they have the apps you need for the [scenarios](/flw-overview.md#choose-your-scenarios) you are implementing. For example, in addition to the standard Teams communications apps like Chat, your scenario might call for apps like:

- [Bookings](bookings-virtual-visits.md) to schedule appointments with clients or customers.
- [Shifts](shifts-for-teams-landing-page.md) to schedule your frontline workforce.
- [OneDrive](/onedrive) for file storage, sharing, collaboration, and syncing capabilities. See the [OneDrive setup guide](https://aka.ms/ODfBquickstartguide) to get started.
- [SharePoint](/sharepoint/sharepoint-online) to share documents and create sites. See the [SharePoint setup guide](https://aka.ms/spoguidance) to get started.
- [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections) to engage and inform your frontline workers. See the [Employee experience dashboard](https://aka.ms/EmployeeExperienceDashboard) guide to get set up.
- [Viva Learning](/sharepoint/build-learning-and-training-experiences-for-employees) to build learning and training experiences for employees.
- [Yammer](/yammer) to connect your workforce across your company. Use the  [Yammer deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/yammerdeploymentguide) prepares your Yammer network by adding domains, defining admins, and combining Yammer networks. Also see these resources to learn how Yammer can work for your frontline workers: [Yammer Ten Communities](https://aka.ms/Yam10Communities) and [Yammer Lookbook](https://aka.ms/Yammer/Lookbook)

## Now, onboard your pilot users and monitor usage and feedback

You are now ready to onboard and train your pilot frontline personnel and start gathering feedback.
