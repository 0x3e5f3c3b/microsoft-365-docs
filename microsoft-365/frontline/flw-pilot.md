# Start with a pilot deployment of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers

Before you commit to a full rollout of Microsoft 365 for frontline workers across your organization, it's a good idea to try it out first with a small set of real people in your organization. Starting with a pilot program first can help you identify:

- Validate user readiness.
- Identify and mitigate issues.
- Help ensure a successful, organization-wide rollout.

For example, a pilot can help you determine:

- Whether the scenarios you've identified match the business needs of your organization.
- What elements will need to be modified or further customized for your organization.
- What training and orientation information you'll need to provide to users before, during, and after they start working with these new tools.

Running a pilot program is part of the overall adoption process. For more information about adopting Microsoft 365 in your organization, see:

- [Microsoft 365 Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/)
- [Microsoft 365 Adoption best practices](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/assets/M365AdoptionGuide.pdf).

We recommend that you prepare for deployment by completing this 30-minute learning path: [Prepare for a Teams deployment with Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/m365-teams-collab-prepare-deployment/)

## Plan your pilot

A successful pilot includes the following:

- Defined start and end dates and clearly defined goals for measuring success. These goals can help you plan the rollout after the pilot is complete. 
    - Create a test plan and process for gathering feedback, plus a communication plan.
- Allow enough time to run the pilot and assess its impact. A minimum of 30 days is recommended.
- Include the right stakeholders and participants, knowing you can add more users throughout the pilot, if necessary. For Microsoft 365 for frontline workers, make sure your stakeholders and participants include not only the business leaders and IT staff, but your frontline managers and workers, so you can both:
    - Ensure you understand their challenges while planning the implementation.
    - You can check to make sure your implementation is having a positive impact on those challenges.
- Start small and take time to pause, assess results, and adjust the pilot.

## Step 1: Set up Microsoft 365 for frontline workers

To get ready for your rollout, here's what you need to do:

1. [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](/microsoftteams/prepare-network.md)
      - This includes configuring your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 domain, SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.
1. Purchase the appropriate licenses for the people in your pilot. Check out [Understand frontline worker user types and licensing](flw-licensing-options.md) to determine the type of licenses you'll need for your users.
1. Configure any [policy packages](/microsoftteams/manage-policy-packages) you want to use in the Microsoft Teams admin centers. For example, you can use the Frontline Manager and Frontline Worker policy packages, or if you are in the healthcare industry, the Healthcare clinical worker policy package.

## Step 2: Configure device support

Determine what devices you'll support. For example, you can use the Teams mobile clients on Android and iOS to provide secure access to Teams and frontline worker apps. See [devices TBD] and [Get the Teams desktop, web, and mobile clients](/microsoftteams/get-clients.md).

## Step 3: Set up teams and apps

[Create the teams](/microsoftteams/get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels) for your pilot, and make sure they have the apps you need for the scenarios you are implementing. For example, in addition to the standard Teams communications apps like Chat, your scenario might call for apps like:

- [Bookings](bookings-virtual-visits.md) to schedule appointments with clients or customers.
- [Shifts](/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/shifts-for-teams-landing-page) to schedule your frontline workforce.
- [Viva Connections](/viva/connections/guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections) to engage and inform your frontline workers.
- [Viva Learning](/sharepoint/build-learning-and-training-experiences-for-employees) to build learning and training experiences for employees.
- [Yammer](/yammer) to connect your workforce across your company. See: [Yammer Ten Communities](https://aka.ms/Yam10Communities) and [Yammer Lookbook](https://aka.ms/Yammer/Lookbook)

## Step 4: Set up email

If you are providing email for your frontline managers and workers, set it up in Microsoft Exchange Online.

Your pilot users can also install the Outlook app to use for their email.

## Now, onboard your pilot users and monitor usage and feedback

You are now ready to onboard and train your pilot frontline personnel and start gathering feedback.
