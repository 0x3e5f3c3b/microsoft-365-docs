# Wellbeing and engagement frontline workers

Nurture a sense of belonging among your frontline team by empowering to engage with your entire organization.

Microsoft’s [Work Trend Index Pulse Report](https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index) surveyed 9,600 frontline workers and discovered:

- 57% of frontline workers wish more was being done to support their mental health.
- 62% of all frontline workers say leadership does not prioritize building culture.
- 58% of frontline workers believe that work stress will either stay the same or worsen in the coming year.

Use [Viva Connections](#connect-frontline-workers-to-your-broader-organization-with-viva-connections), [Yammer](#create-communities-with-yammer), [Praise](#boost-morale-with-praise), [SharePoint, and Microsoft Stream](#support-engagement-with-sharepoint-and-microsoft-stream) to help your frontline team overcome these challenges and feel supported in your organization.

## Connect frontline workers to your broader organization with Viva Connections

Use the Viva Connections app for Microsoft Teams to:

- Connect frontline workers and create opportunities to communicate and engage
- Create a sense of belonging
- Provide tools that help foster well-being
- Recognize and celebrate frontline workers' success
- Make it easy for frontline workers to access important news and announcements
- Empower frontline workers around a common mission and goal

### Get started planning, building, and launching Viva Connections

First, you'll need to conduct a needs assessment to learn more about the shared challenges frontline workers face in your organization. Build a team of stakeholders (such as representatives from HR, operations, and process owners) who can accurately represent the needs of the frontline workforce. Take an inventory of the concerns of workers in different roles and capture opportunities to increase engagement. Work with stakeholders to create a plan that starts solving common issues and can be built-on over time.

Once you know what your frontline team's needs are, follow the [plan, build, and launch guide](/viva/connections/plan-viva-connections) to deploy Viva Connections.

1. **Make sure the right stakeholders are involved** when planning and design for frontline workers so that the needs of the workers are fully represented and understood.

|Goal |Potential stakeholders |
|:----|:----------------------|
|Increase engagement with communications |Internal communications team, HR team, operations team |
|Promote health and wellbeing |HR team, recruitment team, engagement teams, HR teams, health and safety teams |
|Create a supportive digital ecosystem |Operations team, technical and digital teams, owners of employee tools and systems |

2. **Develop goals and the metrics that can be used to measure success** before you deploy Viva Connections with frontline workers. Define goals with stakeholders early in the process to ensure your plan can be measured and improved once its implemented. Develop goals that are specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, and time related.

3. **Create communication channels** that allow frontline workers to share feedback about their experience with Viva Connections, ideas on how to improve the experience, and an opportunity to expand support for more processes and tasks. Consider using existing Yammer and Teams channels that are already focused on supporting frontline workers.

### Increase engagement with communications

Viva Connections is comprised of three main components that can be set up and customized in different ways to highlight tools and resources. As you prioritize and align the scenarios to support, consider how and where certain tools and resources should be located. [Learn more about the differences between desktop and mobile apps](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview#viva-connections-mobile-and-desktop-experiences).

There are several ways to use Viva Connections to communicate with your workforce. Viva Connections features a [Feed where news, content from Yammer, and videos are aggregated and displayed](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview#viva-connections-feed) in a personalized view based on the sites and communities that the viewer follows. The [Dashboard](/viva/connections/create-dashboard) can also be used to highlight certain cards that link to important news sources.
