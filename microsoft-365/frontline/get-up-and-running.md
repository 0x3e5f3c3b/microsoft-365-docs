# Learn where to start with a frontline deployment pilot

Thanks for choosing Microsoft 365 for frontline workers. Whether you're a small business or a large multi-national chain, Teams for frontline workers can help bring your organization together with chats, helpful apps, and more. And no matter whether you're just getting into collaboration tools for the first time, or you've already been using Teams for your non-frontline workers, we can help you get up and running.
