###### To map an instance to an existing team

1. On the **Mapping** page, start by choosing which WFM instance(s) you want to map to Microsoft Teams team(s).
1. Tick the checkbox for each WFM instance you want to map. Instances will only map if you check their boxes.
1. Next, search for and choose the correct Microsoft Teams team.

    Keep in mind that teams that are already mapped to a WFM instance in this connection instance won't be available to map again.
1. Choose the time zone. The closest city will be automatically filled in, but you can change it.
1. When you've mapped all your teams, select **Next**.
