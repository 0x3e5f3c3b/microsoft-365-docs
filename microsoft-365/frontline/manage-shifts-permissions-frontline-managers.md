# Manage Shifts permissions for frontline managers

By default, frontline managers can do the following in Shifts:

- Configure Shifts settings for their teams.  
- Create and manage schedule groups for their teams in Shifts. Schedule groups are used to group frontline workers based on common characteristics within a team, such as departments or job types.

Depending on the needs of your organization, you might need to control which settings frontline managers can configure in Shifts for their teams and whether frontline managers can create and manage schedule groups.

The following table lists the settings that frontline managers can configure for their teams and schedule group management capabilities, and indicates whether you can change these permissions.
