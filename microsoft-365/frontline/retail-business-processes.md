# Simplify business processes for frontline teams

You can use Teams apps, Power Apps, and Power BI to simplify business processes for your frontline teams.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWRzfc]

> [!NOTE]
> Additional capabilities for [financial services](/industry/financial-services), [healthcare](/industry/healthcare), [nonprofit](/industry/nonprofit), and [retail](/industry/retail) environments are available with the Microsoft industry clouds, which include capabilities from Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Azure as well as the Microsoft 365 features.

## Manage schedules, tasks, approvals, updates, and lists

Teams includes many apps to help you and your frontline workforce manage their day-to-day work:

- Use [Shifts](shifts-for-teams-landing-page.md) to create and update schedules for your store team. Your workers can sign up for shifts, trade shifts as needed, and sign in when they start.
- Publish and track [Tasks](/microsoftteams/manage-tasks-app) for your workers, so they know what needs to be done every day.
- Use [Approvals](/microsoftteams/approval-admin) right in your chat to quickly sign off when something is done or needs to be submitted.
- Use [Updates](/microsoftteams/manage-updates-app) to check in on recurring responsibilities and track the progress of larger tasks.
- Keep track of everything else with [Lists](/microsoftteams/manage-lists-app).

## Create custom apps for your organization's needs

Add Power Apps to create low-code or no-code applications for your organization. You can build custom apps to connect your business data, so you can manage inventory or conduct store walks, for example.

> [!TIP]
> Examples are given for the financial services, healthcare, nonprofit, and retail industries, but you can use these apps for an organization in any sector.

|Industry |Example |
|:--------|:-------|
|Financial services |You can create an app for relationship and account managers to track calls and emails to clients. |
|Healthcare |You can create an app to track consumables inventory in exam rooms to make sure all rooms are ready for patients. |
|Nonprofit | You can create an app to track calls and donations for fundraising efforts. |
|Retail | You can create an app to manage and track your inventory, or to conduct store walks where a person in charge checks all areas of a store before opening. |

More information: [Power Apps](/microsoftteams/manage-power-platform-apps) and [Power Apps and Microsoft Teams integration](/powerapps/teams/overview).

## Track key performance indicators (KPIs) with Power BI reports

Share and collaborate on interactive Power BI content in Microsoft Teams channels and chats. You can add a [Power BI tab](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs) to Teams to embed interactive reports and chat in Teams about your reports, and get notified when important things happen in Power BI right in your Teams activity feed.
