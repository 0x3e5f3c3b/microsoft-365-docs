# Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management

## Overview

The [Microsoft Teams Shifts connector for Blue Yonder](shifts-connectors.md#microsoft-teams-shifts-connector-for-blue-yonder) enables you to integrate the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams with Blue Yonder Workforce Management (Blue Yonder WFM). Your frontline workers can seamlessly view and manage their schedules in Blue Yonder WFM from within Shifts.

You can use the [Shifts connector wizard](shifts-connector-wizard.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center or [PowerShell](shifts-connector-blue-yonder-powershell-setup.md) to create a connection and connector instances. After they're set up, you can manage them in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The Connector Management Console page lists each connection and connector instance that you've set up, along with information such as health status and sync interval details. You can also access the wizard to create a new connection and connector instances or make changes to any of your existing ones. For example, you can update sync settings and team mappings.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use PowerShell to manage a connection. For example, you can view an error report, change connection settings, and disable sync. To learn more, see [Use PowerShell to manage your Shifts connection to Blue Yonder Workforce Management](shifts-connector-powershell-manage.md).

## Manage your connection

1. In the left navigation of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), choose **Setup**, and then under **Featured collections**, select **Frontline workers**.
2. Select **Connector Management Console**.

    Here, you'll see a list of all the connections and connector instances you've set up through the wizard or PowerShell, along with information about each one.

    - To create a new connection, select **Add connection** at the top of the page.
    - To update connection settings, choose **Edit** next to an existing connection. You'll see the Connection settings pane, whee you can update the settings that you want.
    - To create a new connector instance, select **Create instance**.
    - To view more details about an existing connector instance, click the instance name. On the details page, you'll see health information, including mapping and account authorization errors (if any), the list of mappings (if any), and more. You can also choose **Edit** to update settings in the wizard.
