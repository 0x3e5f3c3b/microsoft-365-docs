In Topic experiences, you can edit an existing topic. You may need to do this if you want to correct or add additional information to an existing topic page. 

## Requirements

To edit an existing topic, you need to:
- Have a Topic Experiences license.
- Have permissions to [**Who can create or edit topics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/knowledge/topic-experiences-user-permissions). Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Knowledge Network topic permissions settings. 

> [!Note] 
> Users who have permission to manage topics in the Topic center (knowledge managers) already have permissions to create and edit topics.

## Edit a topic page

If you have permissions to edit a topic page, after opening the topic, you will be able to see **Edit** on the top right of the page.

   ![Edit control](../media/knowledge-management/topic-page-edit.png) </br> 

1. On the topic page, select **Edit**.

2. Make the changes you need to the page. This includes updates to the following fields:

    -  Alternate names
    -  Description
    -  Pinned people
    -  Files and pages
    -  Sites

    You can also add static items to the pageâ€”such as text, images, or links by selecting the canvas icon.

3. Select **Republish** to save your changes.
