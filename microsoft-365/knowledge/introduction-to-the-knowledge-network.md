Knowledge Management

Topic Cards 

Knowledge Management uses Topic Cards and Topic Pages for topic definitions. Topic Cards appear automatically when a topic is detected, showing you a description, experts, resources, and other information about the topic. Topic cards appear automatically in Outlook, Word, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams, and will appear in results in Microsoft Search.

In the case of SharePoint, Topic Cards will only be displayed on Modern Pages. 

Topic Pages

In addition to Topic Cards, Topic pages are automatically created by Project Cortex using the source content as a point of reference. The pages can be curated by subject matter experts who can edit or create new topics with wiki-like simplicity, incorporating their knowledge and additional resources, whilst training Project Cortex at the same time. Until a topic or page has been curated the knowledge presented should be taken as suggested and not authoritative. 

People Cards

Project Cortex enhances the existing People card experience by prompting you to add topics based on the work you are doing. These topics are not the same as the terms used by the Professional Information App (PIA). As is the case with Concept Search the topics on a People card will compliment those selected through the PIA. They will be subject to the same curation process. 

Topic Center

Topic pages are aggregated into a Topic Center. The Topic Center delivers a personalized view of relevant knowledge across the organization, including trending relevant topics, and open questions. Through the Topic Center, staff with knowledge curation roles will be able to curate topics and gain insight into the application, usage and distribution of topics. 

In time we will create additional, topic-specific Knowledge Centres that support specific knowledge sharing scenarios, such as major projects, Practices, policies and procedures, or customers. 

Project Cortex includes additional SharePoint web parts that we will use to integrate knowledge and training in destinations such as Compass.
