Knowledge Management uses Microsoft AI technology, Microsoft 365, Delve, Search, and other components and services to build a knowledge network. 

   ![Knowledge Management flow](../media/content-understanding/knowledge-management-flowchart.png) </br> 

It's goal is to delivers information in apps you use everyday, such as Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint.


## Topic discovery

Knowledge Management uses Microsoft AI technology to search for **topics** in your Office 365 environment.

A topic is a phrase or term that is organizationally significant or important. It has a specific meaning to the organization, and has resources related to it that can help people understand what it is and find more information about it.

When a topic is discovered, a **topic page** is created for it that contains information that was gathered through topic discovery, such as:

- Short description of the topic.
- Users who are subject matter experts on the topic.
- Files, pages, and sites that related to the topic.


## Topic management

Topic management is done in your organization's **topic center**. The topic center is created during setup and serves as your center of knowledge for your organization. It will contain a list of all topics that were discovered in your environment, as well as all topic pages that were created for these topics. 

Users you give permissions to will be able to do the following in the topic center:

- Confirm or reject topics that were discovered in your tenant.
- Create new topics manually as needed (for example, if not enough information was provided for it to be discovered through AI).
- Edit existing topic pages.



## Topic curation

AI will continually work to provide you suggestions to improve your topics as changes occur in your environment.

Users who you allow access to see topics in their daily work are allowed to make suggestions to improve them.
