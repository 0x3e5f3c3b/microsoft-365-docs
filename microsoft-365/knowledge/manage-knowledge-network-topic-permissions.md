# Manage topic permissions in Microsoft 365

After you [set up knowledge management](set-up-knowledge-network.md), at any time afterwards an admin can make adjustments to your configuration settings through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

For example, you may need to adjust your settings for any of the following:
- Add new SharePoint sources to mine topics.
- Change which users will have access to topics.
- Change which users have permissions to do tasks on the topic center.
- Change the name of your topic center

## To access knowledge management settings:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Setup**, and then view the **Organizational Knowledge** section.
2. In the **Organizational Knowledge** section, click **Connect people to knowledge**.<br/>
