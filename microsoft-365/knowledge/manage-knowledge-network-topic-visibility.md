# Manage topic visibility in Microsoft 365

After you [set up knowledge management](set-up-knowledge-network.md), at any time afterwards an admin can make adjustments to your configuration settings through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

For example, you may need to adjust your settings for any of the following:
- Add new SharePoint sources to mine topics.
- Change which users will have access to topics.
- Change which users have permissions to do tasks on the topic center.
- Change the name of your topic center


## Requirements 
You must have Global Admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and manage Organizational knowledge tasks.


## To access knowledge management settings:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Setup**, and then view the **Organizational Knowledge** section.
2. In the **Organizational Knowledge** section, click **Connect people to knowledge**.

3. On the **Connect people to knowledge** page, select **Manage** to open the **Knowledge network settings** pane.

    ![knowledge-network-settings](../media/knowledge-network-settings-topic-visibility.png) 


##  Change who can see topics in your organization

Select the **Topic discovery** tab if you want to update who in your organization can see discovered topics in search results and when topics are highlighted in content like SharePoint pages.

1. On the **Topic discovery** tab, under **Who can see topics in the knowledge network**, select **Edit**.
2. On the **Who can see topics in the knowledge network** page, you choose who will have access to topic details, such as highlighted topics, topic cards, topic answers in search, and topic pages. You can select:
    - **Everyone in your organization**
    - **Only selected people or security groups**
    - **No one**

3. Select **Save**.  
 
> [!Note] 
> While this setting allows you to select any user in your organization, only users who have knowledge management licenses assigned to them will be able to view topics.
