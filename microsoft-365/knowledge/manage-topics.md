# Manage topics in the Topic center 

</br>

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4LxDx]  

</br>


In the Topic center, a knowledge manager can view the **Manage topics** page to review topics that have been identified in SharePoint source locations as specified by your knowledge admin.

Knowledge managers help to guide discovered topics through the topic lifecycle in which topics are:

- Suggested: A topic has been identified by AI and has enough supporting resources, connections, and properties to meet the topic threshold.
- Confirmed: A topic that has been suggested by AI is validated. Validation is done by confirmation from a knowledge admin. Additionally, a topic can be confirmed if at least two users give positive feedback through topic feedback that the topic is valid.
- Removed: A topic is rejected by a knowledge admin and will no longer be visible to viewers. The topic can be in any state when it is removed (suggested or confirmed). 
- Published: A confirmed topic that has been manually updated.

## Requirements

To manage topics in the Topic center, you need to:
- Have a Topic Experiences license.
- Have permissions to [**Who can manage topics**](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/knowledge/topic-experiences-user-permissions). Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Knowledge Network topic permissions settings. 

You will not be able to view the Manage Topics page in the Topic Center unless you have the **Who can manage topics** permission.

In the topic center, a knowledge manager can review topics that have been identified in the SharePoint source locations you specified, and can either confirm or reject them. A knowledge manager can also create and publish new topic pages if one was not found in topic discovery, or edit existing ones if they need to be updated.


## Review suggested topics

On the Topic center Manage Topics page, topics that were discovered in your specified SharePoint source locations will be listed in the **Suggested** tab. If needed, a knowledge manager can review unconfirmed topics and choose to confirm or reject them.

To review a suggested topic:

1. On the **Manage topics** page, select the **Suggested** tab, select the topic to open the topic page.</br>

2. On the topic page, review the topic page, and select **Edit** if you need to make any changes to the page.

3. After reviewing the topic, go back to the Manage topics page. For the selected topic, you can:

   - Select the check mark to confirm the topic.
    
   - Select the **x** if you want to reject the topic.

    Confirmed topics will be removed from the **Suggested** list and will now display in the **Confirmed** list.

    Rejected topics will be removed from the **Suggested** list and will now display in the **Removed** tab.

   </br> 

## Confirmed topics

On the Manage topics page, topics that were discovered in your specified SharePoint source locations and have been confirmed by a knowledge manager or "crowd-sourced" confirmed by two or more people through the card feedback mechanism will be listed in the **Confirmed** tab. If needed, a user with permissions to manage topics can review confirmed topics and choose to reject them.

To review a confirmed topic:

1. On the **Confirmed** tab, select the topic to open the topic page.</br>

2. On the topic page, review the topic page, and select **Edit** if you need to make any changes to the page.

Note that you can still chose to reject a confirmed topic.  To do this, go to the selected topic in the Confirmed list, and select the **x** if you want to reject the topic.

## Published topics
Published topics have been edited so that specific information will always appear to whoever encounters the page. Manually created topics are listed here as well.
