# Save a topic as a draft in Microsoft Viva Topics


## Save a new topic as a draft

1.	Create a topic from + New à Topic Page from Topic Center
 

2.	As you’re editing the new topic, a draft is automatically saved.
 

3.	When you're done with your current edits, but not ready to publish, you can click Save as draft to save your changes. Your audience won't see the edits on the page until you publish it. Only people with edit permissions to Topics will be able to see the draft. 
 

4.	Select Publish to save your changes. After you publish the page, the topic name, alternate name description, and pinned people will display to users who can view the topic. Specific files, pages, sites will only appear on the topic page, if the viewer has permissions to the item.
 
## Save a revised topic as a draft

1.	Open a topic page to edit it.
2.	As you’re editing the topic page, a draft is automatically saved.
 
3.	When you're done with your current edits, but not ready to publish, choose Save as draft to save your changes and close edit mode.
4.	When you're ready for users to see your changes, you will see either a Publish or Republish button. 
1.	Publish is available when the topic only has AI-discovered content and you are editing for the first time. On Publish, edits you made to topic name, alternate name, description or pinned people will display to users who can view the topic. Specific files, pages, sites, AI-discovered alternate names and people will still be visible only to those who have permissions to those resources.
2.	If you see Republish, instead, this means that you are editing a previously published topic.
 
## Page lifecycle
 
1.	When you save as draft and close this page, it is checked in as a minor version, and becomes a "shared" draft. This means that anyone with edit permissions (or site owners) can now see the draft and edit it.
2.	Drafts are automatically saved when editing.
3.	Anyone with edit permissions (or site owners) will be taken directly to the saved draft when they open the topic page that is in a draft state. A statement will be shown to tell you that this is a draft page and when the last draft was saved
 

4.	After closing edit mode, you can get back to the drafts by getting back to the topic page:
1.	For users:
1.	From the Confirmed Topics section on Topics web part
2.	By searching for it and opening from Topic answer
2.	For knowledge managers:
1.	From the Manage Topics page
2.	Sites Pages library
3.	From the direct link to the Topic page
 
## One person can edit at a time

Two people cannot edit the same page at the same time, no matter if it’s a draft or not. 
If one person has a page open for editing, and another person tries to edit the page, a message is shown that the page is being edited by someone else.
 
 
You can ask the person who has the page open for editing to "release" the page by saving and closing, discarding changes, or publishing. However, if the page has no activity for 5 minutes, the editing session will automatically time out and the page will be "unlocked.", unless someone closes the browser within 5 minutes.
