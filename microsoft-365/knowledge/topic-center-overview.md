The topic center is a Modern SharePoint site that is a center of knowledge for your organizationâ€‹. 

It is created during Knowledge Management setup in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

You will see only the topics you have access to.

Through the Topic center, you can do the following:

- Confirm or reject discovered topics
- Create a new topic page
- Create or edit topic pages
- Create or edit topic cards

## Permissions to use the Topic Center

To work in the topic center, you need to have the required permissions. Your admin can assign these permissions to users during [knowledge management setup](set-up-knowledge-network.md), or new users can be [added afterwards](give-user-permissions-to-the-topic-center.md) by an admin through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Topic center users can be given two sets of permissions:

- **Create and edit topics**: Create new topics or update topic content such as the description, documents and associated persons
- **Manage topics**: Use the Topic management dashboard to review topics across the organization. Users can perform actions such as confirming and rejecting unconfirmed topics.

A user can be given both sets of permissions, or only one if needed.
