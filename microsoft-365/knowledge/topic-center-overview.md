# Topic center overview (Preview)

The topic center is a Modern SharePoint site that serves as a center of knowledge for your organizationâ€‹. It is created during [Knowledge Management setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

The topic center has a default home page where you can see the topics to which you have been connected or suggested to be connected. Users with the proper permissions can also:

- Create a new topic page
- Confirm or reject suggested topics
- Edit and publish changes to a topic page

> [!Note] 
> You can learn more about each task in [Work with topics in the topic center](work-with-topics.md).

## Where is the topic center

Your topic center is created during Knowledge Management setup. After setup completes, an admin can find the URL on the [knowledge center management page](topic-experiences-discovery.md).

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Setup** in the navigation pane, and in the **Organizational Knowledge** section, select **Connect people to knowledge**.

   ![Connect people to knowledge](../media/content-understanding/manage-connect-people-to-knowledge.png) </br>

2. On the **Connect people to knowledge** page, in the **At a glance** section, see **Topic center address** for the site URL.

## Home page

To see the topic center, you need to have permissions to view topics and the topic experiences. Your admin can assign these permissions to users during [knowledge management setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md), or new users can be [added afterwards](give-user-permissions-to-the-topic-center.md) by an admin through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

On the home page 
- **View topics**: view topic experiences. So you can see topics in the organization and give feedback on topics where you have been connected:
1. Suggested connections - these are topics where my connection has been suggested
2. Confirmed connections - these are topics where I am pinned on the topic or I've confirmed my connection
Topics will move from the suggested to confirmed section when I confirm a suggested connection.
Once I'm pinned, edits to the topic page can be done to curate my connection.

- **Create and edit topics**: New topic is available and you can edit pages


## Permissions to use the Manage Topics capability topic center

To work in the Manage Topics section of topic center, you need to have the required permissions. Your admin can assign these permissions to users during [knowledge management setup](set-up-topic-experiences.md), or new users can be [added afterwards](give-user-permissions-to-the-topic-center.md) by an admin through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Topic center users can be given two sets of permissions:

- **Manage topics**: Use the topic dashboard to review topics across the organization. Users can perform actions such as confirming and rejecting unconfirmed topics.

A user can be given both sets of permissions, or only one if needed. 

## Reviewing topics in the topic dashboard

The topic dashboard shows topics that were mined from your specified source locations. Each topic will show the date the topic was discovered and if any feedback has been provided on it. A user who was assigned **Manage topics** permissions can review the unconfirmed topics and choose to:
- Confirm the topic: Highlights the topic to users who have access and lets them see the associated topic card and topic page.
- Reject the topic: Makes the topic not available to users. The topic is moved to the **Rejected** tab and can be confirmed later if needed.

## Create or edit a topic

If you have **Create and edit topics** permissions, you can choose to:

- Edit existing topics: You can make changes to existing topic pages that were created through discovery.
- Create new topics: You can create new topics for ones that were not found through discovery, or if AI tools did not find enough evidence to create a topic.
