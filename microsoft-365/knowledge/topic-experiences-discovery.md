# Topic Experiences discovery

> [!Note] 
> The content in this article is for Project Cortex Private Preview. [Find out more about Project Cortex](https://aka.ms/projectcortex).

Topic Experiences converts knowledge information to knowledge in your Microsoft 365 environment. We've all experienced reading through documents and site pages where we encounter terms we are unfamiliar with. Many times we stop what we are doing to spend precious time searching for more information.

What Topic Experiences does is use Microsoft Graph and AI to identify **topics** in your organization.  A topic is a phrase or term that has a specific meaning to an organization, where users would benefit by being able to view a wiki page about it. AI searches for people and content connected to the topic, and if enough it discovered, it becomes a suggested topic.

The AI generated topic information is added to a **Topic page**, which can contain:
- A short description of the topic.
- Alternate names for the topic.
- People who might know more about the topic.
- Sites, files, and pages that might be related to the topic.

Topic experiences then makes sure that every instance of a topic is highlighted on all SharePoint modern site pages in your tenant. When a user is curious to learn more about a topic, they can select the highlighted topic to view a **Topic summary** card that provides a short description. And if they want to learn more, they can select a **Topic details** link in the summary to open the detailed topic page.

Additionally, users will also be able to find topics through Microsoft Search.


## Topic curation

Topic Experiences welcomes human "curation" to improve the quality of your topics. While AI initially identifies and suggests topics, manually made updates to content from contributors, confirmation from users for AI generated content, and feedback on the usefulness of topics are all essential.

- AI generated topics ("suggested topics") can be reviewed by **knowledge managers** in your organization. In the Manage Topics page in the Topic Center, they can choose to confirm them as valid, or reject them to prevent them from being viewed.

- You can assign *Create and edit topics* permissions to any of your licensed users so that they can make changes to existing topics or create new topics when needed. 

- Even users who only have read access to topic (topic viewers) will be asked to verify the usefulness of specific topics.

Even with human curation, AI will continually look for more information about topics, and will look for human verification. For example, if AI thinks you are a person that should be pinned as an expert on a topic, it will ask you to confirm this.
