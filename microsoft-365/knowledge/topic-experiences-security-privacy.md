# Topic experiences security and privacy




## Topic stages

Each topic has a stage associated with it as described in the table below.

|Topic stage|Description|
|:----------|:----------|
|Suggested|AI has identified a topic that has supporting resources, connections, and properties.|
|Confirmed|A knowledge manager has confirmed a suggested topic. No updates are made to the topic itself.|
|Published|A knowledge manager or contributor has updated any of the AI-discovered items or added new items to the topic. Topic experiences continues to add to the topic in this stage, increasing its connections. In this stage, a page for the topic is created in the topic center. Manually created topics start as published.|
|Removed|A topic that has been removed from topic experiences by a knowledge manager.|


Permissions are to be read for everyone.

Only specific people can edit 
Only people who can edit will see the Edit button




## Who can see what

pages can contain local content or content that's separately ACL'd

Topic's discoverability is dictated by the resources associated with the topic. 

People with read permissions to the information from which the topic was discovered can discover the topic.

Manually added topics require permissions to be determined by the person adding the topic page. See New Topic.


A mined topic starts with being able to be edited by those that can see it. If a person seeing the result wants to change any information on the topic, this is the curation for everyone who sees the topic.

Page is created in single knowledge center
Default permissions is to be read and write for everyone
The information curated on the page will be visible to everyone
Suggestions continue to be security-protected


[who can see topics in your organization](topic-experiences-knowledge-rules#change-who-can-see-topics-in-your-organization) determines who has access to the topic center. You can change topic page permissions for individual topics, but this is not recommended.


The topic name is visible. Correct â€“ AI discovered descriptions are protected by source document. The human edit is visible only if the topic page is visible


Suggested people are protected by the source documents. Pinned people will always be visible.

The information on the topic page that becomes visible to you when you have permissions to the topic page:
-	Name
-	Description
-	Pinned people
-	Suggested people if they have permissions to the source document
-	Pinned files and pages that they have permissions to
-	Suggested files and pages that they have permissions to
-	Suggested sites that they have permissions to
-	Added sites that they have permissions to

If AI associates a document to a Manually created topic and I don't have access to the document, you don't see the document


AI discovers
anyone can see the title

people with page perms see all human-created content on the page
they only see associated info if they have perms to it

When a topic is first discovered, knowledge managers can see it in the topic center. Depending on the completeness and relevance of the topic, topic viewers may or may not see the topic presented in topic cards.

Topic viewers can see published topics in the topic center. 


## Best practices

workflow for requesting changes


we don't do anything to prevent people from creating topics. (people with create and edit perms)
