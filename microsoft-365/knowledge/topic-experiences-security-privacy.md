# Topic experiences security and privacy

Topic experiences uses existing content security features in Microsoft 365 to control what AI-generated content is shown to users in your organization. 

Topic experiences provides two additional ways to control access to topics:

- [Admin controls to prevent specified sites and topic names from being included in topic experiences](topic-experiences-discovery.md)
- Permissions for individual users to view or edit topics and access the topic center

It is the combination of Microsoft 365 security settings (permissions to sites, files, and folders) and topic experiences admin settings that determine what a given user can see in topic experiences.

## Topic stages

Each topic has a stage associated with it as described in the table below.

|Topic stage|Description|
|:----------|:----------|
|Suggested|A topic which AI has identified that has supporting resources, connections, and properties.|
|Confirmed|A suggested topic that a knowledge manager has confirmed without making any changes to the topic itself.|
|Published|A topic where a knowledge manager or contributor has updated any of the AI-discovered items or added new items to the topic. Topic experiences continues to add to the topic in this stage, increasing its connections. In this stage, a page for the topic is created in the topic center. Manually created topics start as published.|
|Removed|A topic that has been removed from topic experiences by a knowledge manager.|

As topics move through the stages to published, they become more complete and more likely to be presented to users in highlights and topic cards.

## Who can see what

To see topics, a user must:

- Have a Topic Experiences license
- Be a [topic viewer](topic-experiences-knowledge-rules.md#change-who-can-see-topics-in-your-organization)

These two things give a user view access to the topic center and allow them to see highlights and topic cards.

Topic contributors additionally have [create and edit](topic-experiences-user-permissions.md#change-who-has-permissions-to-do-tasks-on-the-topic-center) permissions. They can create and update topics.

Topics can contain information generated by AI and information added or edited by topic contributors or knowledge managers.

- Information in a topic that was added by AI is only visible to people who have access to the source content.
- Information that has been manually added or edited by a topic contributor or knowledge manager is visible to everyone who can see the topic.

Topic viewers and contributors can see the list of confirmed and published topics in the topic center, but the topic details that a given person can see depends on the permissions that they have to the source material and on whether the topic has been manually edited.

The following table describes what topic viewers and contributors can see in a given topic based on their permissions.

|Topic item|What people can see|
|:---------|:------------------|
|Topic name|Topic viewers and contributors can see the topic name of all topics in the topic center. Some topics may not be visible if they have a low relevancy to the user.|
|Topic description|AI-generated descriptions are visible only to people who have permissions to the source content. Manually entered or updated descriptions are visible to all topic viewers and contributors.|
|People|Pinned people are visible to all viewers and contributors. Suggested people are only visible to people who have permissions to the source content.|
|Files|Files are only visible to topic viewers and contributors who have permissions to the source content.|
|Pages|Pages are only visible to topic viewers and contributors who have permissions to the source content.|
|Sites|Sites are only visible to topic viewers and contributors who have permissions to the source content.|








When a topic is first discovered, knowledge managers can see it in the topic center. Depending on the completeness and relevance of the topic, topic viewers may or may not see the topic presented in topic cards.

Topic viewers can see published topics in the topic center. 


## Best practices

Topic experiences presents information to users based on their existing permissions to content. Microsoft 365 provides a variety of ways to ensure that sensitive content is restricted to appropriate users. Beyond standard team or site permissions, you can use [sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) or [data loss prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/data-loss-prevention-policies) to restrict access to content and [access reviews](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview) to periodically review user access to sensitive information.

We recommend that you use these tools to ensure that your content permissions are set appropriately inside your organization. Topic experiences can then provide useful and appropriate information to your users.

If there are topics that you want to exclude entirely from the knowledge network, you can also:

- [Exclude sensitive SharePoint sites from topic discovery](topic-experiences-discovery.md#select-sharepoint-topic-sources). Content in these sites will not appear in topic experiences.

- [Exclude topics by name](topic-experiences-discovery.md#exclude-topics-by-name). Topics explicitly excluded will not appear in topic experiences.

- Have knowledge managers remove topics in the topic center.

Additionally, we recommend these best practices:

- Set up a workflow for requesting changes. Knowledge managers or team or site owners should have a process by which they can request exclusion of topics or sites as new projects are started within your organization.

- Be aware of the audience and the sensitivity of information when creating topic descriptions. These descriptions may be visible to users who don't have permissions to the source content for the topic.

While you can change the permissions on individual topic pages to narrow access to a specific group of users, we don't recommend this approach because of the high degree of administrative effort required.
