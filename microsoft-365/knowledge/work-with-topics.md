# Work with topics in the Knowledge Center (Preview)

> [!Note] 
> The content in this article is for Project Cortex Private Preview. [Find out more about Project Cortex]().

In the Project Cortex Knowledge Center, a knowledge manager can review topics that have been mined and discovered in the SharePoint source locations you specified, and can either confirm or reject them.

## Reviewing unconfirmed topics

On the Knowledge Center home page, topics that were discovered in your specified SharePoint source locations will be listed in the **Unconfirmed** tab.


To review an unconfirmed topic:

1. On the **Unconfirmed** tab, select the topic to open the topic page.</br>

    ![Unconfirmed topics](../media/content-understanding/k-unconfirmed-topics.png) </br>

1. On the topic page, review the topic page, and select **Edit** if you need to make any changes to the page.
2. On the Knowledge Center home page, for the selected topic, you can:</br>
    a. Select the check to confirm that you want to keep the topic.</br>
    b. Select the x if you want to reject the topic.</br>

    Confirmed topics will be removed from the **Unconfirmed** list and will now display in the **Confirmed** tab.</br>

    Rejected topics will be removed from the **Unconfirmed** list and will now display in the **Rejected or Excluded** tab.</br>
    
   
## Create a new topic

A knowledge center admin can create a new topic if needed. You might need to do this if the topic was not discovered through discovery or if the AI technology did not find enough evidence to establish it as a topic.

To create a new topic:
1. On the Knowledge Center page, select **New**, then select **Topic Page**.</br>

    ![New topic](../media/content-understanding/k-new-topic.png) </br>

2. 
    ![New topic page](../media/content-understanding/k-new-topic-page.png) </br>
