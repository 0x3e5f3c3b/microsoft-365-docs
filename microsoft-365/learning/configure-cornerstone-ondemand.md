<!--Note : Snapshots are temporary, we will have final snapshots from CSOD team once they create Viva Learning tile in CSOD portal.-->

Please note: Data residency: Tenant metadata is stored centrally in our data stores & not stored in geo specific data stores.

## Roles & Permissions

Today, all the users within an organization will be able to discover all the tenant specific courses but they will only be able to access/ consume the courses that they have access to. User specific content discovery (based on roles & permissions) is part of our future roadmap.
