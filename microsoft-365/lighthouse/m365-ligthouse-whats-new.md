# What's new in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?

We're continuously adding new features to [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview.md), fixing issues we learn about, and making changes based on your feedback. Take a look below to see what's available for you today. Some features get rolled out at different speeds to our customers. If you aren't seeing a feature yet, you should see it soon.

## March 2022

### Windows 365 Business integration and management actions

Based on user feedback, we integrated the Windows 365 Business edition into Lighthouse. This will help you manage and monitor all your customers' Cloud PCs from a single place. 

In addition to integrating with Windows 365 Business Cloud PCs in Lighthouse, you can now take the following management actions:

- Restart
- Reprovision
- Rename
 
To learn more about the new features, see [Overview of the Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview.md).

### Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Partner Amendment

Now that Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is in General Availability, we are requiring our current partners to sign an updated Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partner amendment. All Lighthouse partners who signed up during the preview period will be prompted to complete this new agreement in the coming weeks. Completion will require global administrator rights in the partner tenant and must be completed within 90 days to continue accessing the Lighthouse portal.

## February 2022

### Granular Delegated Access Permissions (GDAP) roles
