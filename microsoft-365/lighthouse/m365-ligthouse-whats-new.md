# What's new in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?

We're continuously adding new features to [Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview.md), fixing issues we learn about, and making changes based on your feedback. Take a look below to see what's available for you today. Some features get rolled out at different speeds to our customers. If you aren't seeing a feature yet, you should see it soon.

## April 2022

### Delegated access type and roles on Tenants page

We've updated the Tenants page to list the Managed Service Provider (MSP)'s delegated access type (None, DAP, GDAP, or Both DAP & GDAP) per customer under the **Delegated access** column. We've also added a new column titled **Your roles** that lists the DAP and GDAP roles per customer for a signed-in user. These two enhancements to the Tenants page will make it easier for partner technicians to understand which types of delegated administrative permissions are available for each customer and which delegated roles have explicitly been granted to them.

To learn more, see [Overview of permissions in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-overview-of-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is being rolled out and may not be immediately available in all tenants.

## March 2022

### Windows 365 Business integration and management actions

Based on user feedback, we integrated the Windows 365 Business edition into Lighthouse. This will help you manage and monitor all your customers' Cloud PCs from a single place. 

In addition to integrating with Windows 365 Business Cloud PCs in Lighthouse, you can now take the following management actions:

- Restart
- Reprovision
- Rename
 
To learn more about the new features, see [Overview of the Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview.md).

### Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partner amendment

Now that Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is in General Availability, we require our current partners to sign an updated Microsoft 365 Lighthouse partner amendment. All Lighthouse partners that signed up during the preview period will be prompted to complete this new agreement in the coming weeks. Completion will require global administrator rights in the partner tenant and must be completed within 90 days to continue accessing the Lighthouse portal.

## February 2022

### Granular Delegated Access Permissions (GDAP) roles

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse now includes the capability for MSPs to use Granular Delegated Access Permissions (GDAP) roles. With the latest update, MSPs can leverage GDAP roles for their technicians that enable the principle of least privilege access in Lighthouse. This capability reduces the risks inherent in the broad permissions of the Delegated Access Permissions (DAP) role of the Admin Agent by enabling granular controls on the customers' data and settings that each technician will be able to work with.

To learn more about GDAP in Lighthouse, see [Configure Microsoft 365 Lighthouse portal security](m365-lighthouse-configure-portal-security.md).

### Notify users to act on non-compliant devices

As part of the device compliance baseline step, we added the capability to notify users in a customer tenant to act on non-compliant devices. With this change, once you apply the device compliance deployment step for any customer tenant, the device compliance policy created in that tenant will automatically send a notification to users when their device becomes non-compliant reminding them to take appropriate action to bring the device back into compliance.
