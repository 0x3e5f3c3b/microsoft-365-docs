# Fix issues found by the readiness assessment tool

For each check, the tool will report one of three possible results:


|Result  |Meaning  |
|---------|---------|
|Ready     | No action is required before completing enrollment.        |
|Advisory    | Follow the steps in the tool or this article for the best experience with enrollment and for users. You *can* complete enrollment, but you must fix these issues before you deploy your first device.        |
|Not ready | *You can't complete enrollment without fixing these issues.* Follow the steps in the tool or this article to resolve them.        |

## Microsoft Intune settings

### Mobile Device Management (MDM) authority

The MDM Authority must be set to Intune. If you are using hybrid MDM, see [What happened to hybrid MDM?](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/mdm/understand/what-happened-to-hybrid) for steps to change this. {THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AN ARTICLE ON "CHANGE YOUR MDM AUTHORITY." THE PROVIDED LINK JUST POINTS TO THE SAME ARTICLE}

### Windows devices managed by Intune

This item is just for your information, to let you know how many Windows devices you have managed by Intune.


### MDM user scope

For Microsoft Managed Desktop users to be able to enroll devices, the MDM user scope must be set to **All** or **Some**.

This setting will be adjusted when you enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop. If it's set to **None** beforehand, we will set it to **Some** and select all Microsoft Managed Desktop groups. If it's set to **Some** beforehand, we will only add Microsoft Managed Desktop groups.

Users must be added {WHO DOES THIS? MMD OR THE ADMIN PRIOR TO ENROLLMENT?} to Modern Workplace -all {WHAT IS THIS? SO I KNOW HOW TO FORMAT IT} to allow registered Windows devices to enroll into Intune MDM.

### Device type restrictions

You must allow the Windows MDM platform {WHAT KIND OF ENTITY IS THIS?} to enroll into Intune.

Device enrollment restrictions are assigned to user groups.

**If you use the Default restriction (that applies to all users):**

Ensure that **Select Platforms > Windows (MDM)** is set to **Allow** and that **Configure platforms > Windows (MDM)** uses a minimum and maximum range (if required) that will allow Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Microsoft Managed Desktop isn't affected by the **Personally owned** configuration.

**If you use multiple device enrollment restrictions:**

Ensure that Microsoft Managed Desktop users are not within the scope of any device restrictions that prevent corporate Windows enrollment from completing successfully.

You can do this by creating a new device restriction with a higher priority than other device enrollment restrictions that is targeted to the Modern Workplace -All group and that has the following settings:
  
- **Select Platforms > Windows (MDM)** set to **Allow**  
- **Configure platforms > Windows (MDM)** set to **Allow**  


### Enrollment Status Page

You currently have the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) enabled. ESP isn't supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop. Depending on your situation, you have these options to fix this:

**I use the Default Enrollment Status page in order to show app and profile installation progress, but I don't mind modifying it:**

Select the profile and choose **Settings**. Set **Show app and profile installation progress** to **No** and then select **Save**. 

**I use the Default Enrollment Status page to show app and profile installation progress, but I want to keep using it for my devices that aren't managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop:**

Select the profile and choose **Settings**. Set **Show app and profile installation progress** to **No** and then select **Save**.

In the **Enrollment Status Page** section, select **Create Profile** and create a new profile with **Show app and profile installation progress** enabled. Then assign this profile new profile to a group that contains your Autopilot devices that aren't managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop.

**I have both default and custom Enrollment Status Page profiles:**

Review the settings for your multiple enrollment status page profiles and ensure that any that have **Show app and profile installation progress** set to **Yes** don't have an assignment or priority that would mean they apply to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

For more information, see [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status).


### Autopilot profile

You shouldn't have any existing Autopilot profiles that target assigned or dynamic groups with Autopilot profiles used by Microsoft Managed Desktop. This is because Microsoft Managed Desktop uses Autopilot to provision new devices.

If you use Azure AD dynamic groups to assign Autopilot profiles with membership rules that use the ZTDID field to assign devices, follow these steps depending on your situation:

If your dynamic group uses a generic rule that could include both Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and other devices Use the example guidance below to help youâ€™re your required remediation actions:  {IT'S UNCLEAR IF THIS AND THE PRECEDING PARA ARE TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, TWO WAYS OF STATING THE SAME ONE, OR IF ONE IS A SUBSET OF THE OTHER--PLZ CLARIFY}

**I use the Autopilot "catch all devices" rule:**

An example is **(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any _ -contains "[ZTDId]")**. Instead, either use a different group that doesn't use the ZTDID query or modify the membership rule to use a less generic query. For example, you could use OrderIDs to limit the group to include only the ones that have a specific **Order ID:  (device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -eq "[OrderID]:123456789")**.

**I use a Windows-based "catch all devices" rule*:**

Any group using this rule will include devices including those managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop, since those are also based on Windows.

Instead, either use a more specific assignment group or exclude the Modern Workplace Devices -all group from each device-targeted assignment.

**I use a hardware-based "catch all devices" rule:**

An example is **(device.deviceModel -contains "Surface")**. Any group that uses this rule could include Microsoft Managed Desktop devices that happen to have the same manufacturer or model.

Instead, either use a more specific assignment group or exclude the Modern Workplace Devices -all group from each device-targeted assignment.

### Autopilot devices

{PER SPEC: "One or multiple (documentation to be written)"}
