# Order Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can reach out to your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership.

In the meantime, you can review the list of [currently approved devices](../../service-description/devicelist.md) that are supported for use with Microsoft Managed Desktop.
