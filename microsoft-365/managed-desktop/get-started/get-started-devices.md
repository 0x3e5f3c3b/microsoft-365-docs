# Get started using Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

Microsoft Managed Desktop devices come pre-configured with the current version of Windows. Configurations and apps will be installed from the cloud as the user completes setting up the device. 
 
There are only a few steps a user needs to take during device set up to be productive with their device. Microsoft Managed Desktop recommends using *Get started with your device* guide linked below. This downloadable guide provides basic instructions for setting up a new Microsoft Managed Desktop device. We've designed this guide to be a baseline for IT administrators. Use it as is, or update it to add steps or info that will help your users set up their devices. 

## Get started guide 
You can download the guide here: [Microsoft Managed Desktop - Get started with your device](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57918).

## What should I update in the Get started guide?

Here are a few ways IT administrators can personalize *Get started with your device*:
- Include the preferred internet the user should connect to in step 2
- Give the user with the appropriate username, or domain name to enter at step 3
- Add a support contact within your organization for support outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support
- Add instructions about where to pick up their device (if this is separate from these instructions)
