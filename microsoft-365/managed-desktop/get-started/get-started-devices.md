# Get your users ready to use devices

Once a Microsoft Managed Desktop device is in the hands of your end user, getting started with it is fast and easy. Devices come pre-configured with the current version of Windows, and configurations and apps are installed from the cloud as the user completes setup. 
 
To make this even easier, we offer four versions of a user guide that walk your users through the initial setup and provide help resources both for the setup and for use later, if needed.

- A ready-to-use guide in two varieties: one for organizations using Microsoft's support system (the Get Help app), one for those providing their own end-user support
- A customizable guide in the same varieties that you can edit to include details specific to your organization

## Ready-to-use guides
1. Download the version appropriate to your organization:
- [Microsoft Managed Desktop - Get started with your device](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57918).
- 
2. Distribute to your end users either as PDF or hard copy.

## Customizable guides

1. Download the version appropriate to your organization:
- [Microsoft Managed Desktop - Get started with your device](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57918).
- 
2. Use any app capable of opening PDF files to fill in details relevant to your organization:
    - 
    -     
    -
3. Save the edited PDF, and then istribute to your end users either as PDF or hard copy. 

At this point, you're ready to move on to deploying apps:
