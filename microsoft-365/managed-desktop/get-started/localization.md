# Localize devices for users

Users of Microsoft Managed Desktop devices can select the [supported language](#supported-languages) and locale of their choice either during the setup process or afterwards.

## During setup

During the process of completing setup, users can select the display and keyboard language for Windows 10 and language-related Features on Demand. They can also set the language used for display and proofing and authoring tools used by Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise.


## After completing setup

Anytime after the setup process is complete, users can select the display and keyboard language for Windows 10 and the language used for display and proofing and authoring tools in Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise. They can't install any language-related Features on Demand however.

## Supported languages

For new devices, your manufacturer must provide device images that include the languages you require. If you need language-supporting images for existing languages, file a [support request](../working-with-managed-desktop/admin-support.md) by using the [Admin portal](access-admin-portal.md). If your manufacturer's image includes languages beyond those provided in the Microsoft Managed Desktop universal image, that is still supported by the service.

The universal image provided by Microsoft Managed Desktop includes these languages and locales for Windows 10:

- English (US, GB, AU, CA, IN)
- Spanish (Spain, Mexico)
- Japanese
- French (France, Canada)
- German
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Italian
- Chinese Simplified
- Dutch  
- Swedish
- Danish  
- Finnish 
- Russian 
- Norwegian (Bokmal)
- Korean
- Chinese Traditional
- Polish
- Turkish
- Arabic
- Hebrew
- Portuguese (Portugal)
- Czech
- Hungarian
- Thai
- Indonesian
- Greek
- Slovak
- Vietnamese
- Slovenian
- Croatian
- Romanian
- Lithuanian
- Bulgarian
- Serbian (Latin alphabet)
- Latvian
- Ukrainian
- Estonian

Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise might support a different list.

## Languages for support and operations

Microsoft Managed Desktop provides support only in English. This includes the Admin portal and all communications with Operations. If users choose another language in the Get Help app, they will get support from the general Microsoft support channels, rather than specific help for Microsoft Managed Desktop. For more information, see [Getting help for users](../working-with-managed-desktop/end-user-support.md).

If your users need support in other languages, you'll have to provide that through non-Microsoft support sources or from your own organization.
