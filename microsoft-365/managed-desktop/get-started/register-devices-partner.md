# Steps for Partners to register devices


This topic describes the steps for Partners to follow to register devices. The process for registering devices yourself is documented in [Register devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop yourself](register-devices-self.md).



## Prepare for registration 
Before completing registration for a customer, you must first establish a relationship with them at the [Partner Center] (https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). See the [consent documentation] (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/registration-auth#csp-authorization) for more details on that process. Any CSP partner can add devices on behalf of any customer, as long as the customer consents. You can also learn more about partner relationship and Autopilot permissions at [Partner Center help] (https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/customers_revoke_admin_privileges#windows-autopilot)


>[!NOTE]
> This documentation is only for Partners and OEMs. The process for self-registration is documented in [Register devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop yourself](register-devices-self.md).


## Register devices by using Partner Center

Once you have established the relationship with your customers, you can leverage Partner Center to add devices to Autopilot for any of the customers that you have a relationship with following the below steps :

1. Navigate to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard)
2. Select **Customers** from the Partner Center menu and then select the customer whose devices you want to manage.
3. On the customer's detail page, select **Devices**.
4. Under **Apply profiles** to devices select **Add devices**.
5. Enter **Microsoft365Managed_Autopilot** for the Group Name and then select **Browse** to upload the customer's list (in .csv file format) to Partner Center.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>The group name must match exactly **Microsoft365Managed_Autopilot** including capitalization and special characters. This will allow the newly registered devices to be assigned with the Microsoft Managed Desktop Autopilot Profile.

>[!NOTE]
> You should have received this .csv file with your device purchase. If you didn't receive a .csv file, you can create one yourself by following the steps in [Adding devices to Windows Autopilot] (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/add-devices#collecting-the-hardware-id-from-existing-devices-using-powershell). You will notice that the PowerShell Script is different from the one used for the [Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/get-started/register-devices-self?view=o365-worldwide#obtain-the-hardware-hash). Partners should now start using [Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo] (https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo) moving forward for registering devices for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices in Partner Center.

If you get an error message while trying to upload the .csv file, check the format of the file. You can use the hardware hash only, or the OEM name, serial number, and model (in that column order), or the Windows Product ID. You can also use the sample .csv file provided from the link next to Add devices to create a device list. 

For more information about Autopilot in Partner, see Add devices to a [customerâ€™s account] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/autopilot#add-devices-to-a-customers-account).


## Register devices by using OEM API

Before completing registration for a customer, you must first an OEM establish a relationship with them Each OEM has a unique link to provide to their respective customers. See [how to establish OEM relationship] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/registration-auth#oem-authorization).

1. OEM establish the relationship with the customer.
2. Once the relationship is established, OEM can start registering devices for customers leveraging the Group Tag **Microsoft365Managed_Autopilot**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The group name must match exactly **Microsoft365Managed_Autopilot** including capitalization and special characters. This will allow the newly registered devices to be assigned with the Microsoft Managed Desktop Autopilot Profile.
