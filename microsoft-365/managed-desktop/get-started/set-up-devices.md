# Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

You can use both new and existing devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## To obtain new devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership. In essence, however, the process is like this:

1. Review the list of [currently approved devices](../service-description/device-list.md).
2. Order the devices, working with an approved device partner.
3. Once they've arrived, do either of the following:
    - [Register new devices yourself](register-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
4. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

## To reuse existing devices

1. Review the list of [currently approved devices](../service-description/device-list.md) to identify which of your devices is approved for use with Microsoft Managed Desktop. If you reuse an existing device, you will have to reimage it.
2. Do either of the following:
    - [Register existing devices yourself](register-reused-devices-self.md)
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
3. [Get your users ready](get-started-devices.md) to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices
