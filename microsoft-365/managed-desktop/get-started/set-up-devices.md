# Set up Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

You can either order brand-new devices to use with Microsoft Managed desktop or re-use your existing devices {BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE ON THE DEVICE LIST, RIGHT?} or do some of both.

## To obtain new devices

We recommend working with one of our approved device partners. You can work with your Microsoft account contact for more help setting up a device partnership. In essence, however, the process is like this:

1. Review the list of [currently approved devices](../service-description/device-list.md).
2. Order the devices, working with an approved device partner.
3. Once they've arrived, do either of the following:
    - Register the devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop yourself
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
4. Get your users ready to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

## To re-use existing devices

1. Review the list of [currently approved devices](../service-description/device-list.md) to identify which of your devices is approved for use with Microsoft Managed Desktop. If you re-use an existing device, it will be re-imaged.
2. Do either of the following:
    - Register the devices in Microsoft Managed Desktop yourself
    - Work with a partner to register the devices
3. Get your users ready to use Microsoft Managed Desktop devices

{IF YOU WANT TO DO BOTH NEW AND REUSED, THEN....?}
