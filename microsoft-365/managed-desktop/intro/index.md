# What is Microsoft Managed Desktop?

<!--from Overview-->

Microsoft Managed Desktop is a service you can subscribe to that provides monitored IT services for registered devices. It brings together [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-overview) (including Windows 10 Enterprise and Office 365 ProPlus), cloud-based device management by Microsoft, and security monitoring, enabling you to free up your IT teams to focus on core business needs.

## Microsoft 365 Enterprise
As part of registering with Microsoft Managed Desktop, you'll obtain a Microsoft 365 Enterprise [E3 or E5 license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans?rtc=1).

Microsoft 365 Enterprise includes Windows 10 Enterprise, Office 365 ProPlus, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

### Windows 10 Enterprise
Addresses the needs of both large and midsize organizations, providing users with the most productive and secure version of Windows and IT professionals with comprehensive deployment, device, and app management. Learn more at [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10/).

### Office 365 ProPlus
[Office 365 ProPlus](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/about-office-365-proplus-in-the-enterprise) is a version of Office that's available as part of Microsoft 365 Enterprise. It includes the applications that you're familiar with, including Access, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher, Skype for Business, and Word. You can use these applications to connect with Office 365 services such as SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Skype for Business Online.

### Enterprise Mobility + Security
[Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/enterprise-mobility-security/#pivot=products&panel=products-all) is a collection of inter-related products and features designed to manage devices and users, control access, protect information, and detect, analyze, and protect against threats. It includes these products:

- [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/index)
- [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/index)
- [System Center Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/)
- [Microsoft Could App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/)
- [Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/)
- [Multi-factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/index)
- [Advanced Threat Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/advanced-threat-analytics/)
- [Azure Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/)
- [Microsoft Identity Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-identity-manager/)

## Device management
Microsoft Managed Desktop takes on the burden of managing registered devices and the software they use.

- Hardware: Instead of your IT department having to research and test devices, specific devices are carefully tested by Microsoft Managed Desktop, resulting in a curated [list of devices](../service-description/device-list.md) that are guaranteed to work with the service. You can either obtain devices yourself (or work with a partner) or reuse devices you already have, provided they are on the approved list.
- Updates: Microsoft Managed Desktop sets up and manages all aspects of [deployment rings](../service-description/updates.md) for Windows 10 quality and feature updates, drivers, firmware, anti-virus definitions, and Office ProPlus updates, assuring that registered devices are always up to date and freeing your IT department from that ongoing task.
- Apps: As part of Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft provides (and manages) a number of key apps for you. But you probably also have a number of other apps that you need for your business. Instead of your IT department having to test, package, and deploy those apps, when you subscribe to Microsoft Managed Desktop, we will handle all of those operations for you. Learn more at [Apps in Microsoft Managed Desktop](../get-ready/apps.md).
