# Customize the Microsoft Managed Desktop service

Microsoft Managed Desktop Customizations
Microsoft Managed Desktop provides a curated device list,  standard device settings, applications requirements, and certain configurable settings, all designed to provide a secure, productive, and pleasant experience for end users. It’s best to always stay with the service as provided. However, we recognize that some details of the service might not fit exactly with your organization’s needs.   If you feel you need to alter the service in some way, it’s important that you follow the following processes to request those changes. 
Types of customizations
A customization is any addition or change to the Microsoft Managed Desktop base configuration; examples range from USB ports configuration to deploying a new security agent. We group various customizations as follows:
Type 	Description
Productivity software
Foreground software needed by end users;restricted by the application requirements

Security agents & VPNs	Software used to secure, monitor, or change the behavior of the device or network
Digital experience monitoring 
Software used to track data on a user’s device for the purpose of reporting to IT
Hardware or software drivers
Device drivers restricted by the application requirements

Policies
Windows 10 or Office 365 ProPlus settings on a managed device

Devices	Devices which are not on the Microsoft Managed Desktop device list

Other	Anything not covered by the other areas

 
Request a customization
Submit requests through the Microsoft Managed Desktop Admin portal by creating a change request. Be sure to include these details:
-	Customization type: Which category of customization is it? (see the table)
-	Requirement: What is the specific business requirement for the customization?
-	Proposal: Which solution is your business requesting?
-	Modernization timeline: How long do you want this customization to last? 
How we assess a customizations request
When we review customization requests, we asses these factors in this order: 
1.	Some applications and policies which Microsoft Managed Desktop deploys to all devices are not negotiable. So your request must not affect those.
2.	We are likely to approve restricted productivity software if an end user requires it to do their job.
3.	If we can’t meet your requirement by using Microsoft technology, we’re likely to approve your request, unless it violates one of the conditions<internal link>.. 
4.	If we can meet your requirement by using Microsoft technology we’ll approve your request for a 3-12 month migration period (depending on the scope of the project). 
These principles ensure that Microsoft Managed Desktop can always meet our customer’s needs while tracking deviations from our standard template. 
Key conditions
As your requested customization is deployed, it’s possible that we might discover problems with it that weren’t evident when we approved the change in the first place. If this happens, we might have to revoke the customization. These are factors that could cause this to happen:
Approved customizations are subject to the following conditions and may be revoked based on the criteria below:
-	We discover that the change adversely affect security. 
-	We find that maintaining the customization becomes a significant cost for Microsoft Managed Desktop operations or support.
-	We observe that the change adversely affects stability, for example by causingkernel mode crashes or hangs.
-	The change prevents us from operating the service or it conflicts with core Microsoft Managed Desktop technology.
These conditions could change in the future. If we do make such changes, we’ll provide 30 days notice prior to those conditions coming into effect. 
Revoking approval for a customization
If we discover that a customization becomes problematic, we’ll notify you by using the ervice administration portal. We won’t remove a customization without giving you ample notification, following this timeline: T-90 days: We provide the first notice of our decision to revoke approval, including information about why we’re revoking it, the actions we advise you to take, the deadline for those actions, and steps to follow if you want to appeal the decision. T-60 days: We provide a second notice, including the same information provided in the first notice. T-30 days: We provide a third notice, including the same information provided in the first notice. T-1 week: We provide a fourth notice, including the same information provided in the first notice.
T+1: Microsoft Managed Desktop service-level agreements no longer apply to any devices that have the revoked customization. are no At any time, you can challenge the decision and provide additional information for consideration, including upgrade, configuration changes, or change of software.
