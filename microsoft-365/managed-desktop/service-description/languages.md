#  Languages and regions supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop

In addition to the supported devices for Microsoft Managed Desktop, the following regions and languages are supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop currently:

- Regions: North America, Canada (excluding Quebec), United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand
- Languages: English is the only supported language for phone and chat conversations with customers

Customers can operate a device managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop outside of the regions listed above. For example, a UK-based employee continues to receive Windows, Office, drivers, firmware, and Microsoft Store for Business application updates from Microsoft Managed Desktop while travelling with their device managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop to Asia, Europe or South America.

Also, customers can install additional language packs on devices managed by Microsoft Managed Desktop. A support interaction, though, can only proceed if the user permits the device to be set back to the English language for that purpose â€“ since support only can be provided in one of the languages supported by Microsoft Managed Desktop (what is English-only for now).
