# Getting help for end users

There are two ways that users in your organization can get help with their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices: **Get Help** app, or phone support. 

## Get Help app

The preferred method for providing support to your users is **Get Help**.

This is an application that’s installed on all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and is pinned to the task bar. 

- End users can request a phone call, or chat online with a service rep.
- Requests that fall outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support scope are redirected to the local IT helpdesk via phone call.  

Get Help is designed to be easy for end-user professionals to use. 

## Phone support

End users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices also have access to toll-free phone numbers they can call. This is meant to be used when Get Help isn’t available. For example, if they can’t sign in to the device, or the device is broken. Here are the phone numbers for phone support:

- United States: +1855-425-0216
- United Kingdom: +442076601135
- Australia: +61 180 037 0619
