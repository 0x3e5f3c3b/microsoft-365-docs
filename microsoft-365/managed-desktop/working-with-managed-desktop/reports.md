# Work with reports

Microsoft Managed Desktop provides reports that IT admins in your tenant can use to understand various aspects of the population of devices. You access these in the [Admin portal ](https://aka.ms/mmdportal)under **Reporting**.


## Device compliance report

The main view shows the percentage of your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices that conform to compliance policies set in Microsoft Intune. You can also view specific information for either all of your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices or only those that do not conform to compliance policies and export a file with the same information.
