## Device usage

In the **Device usage** area, we display the usage level of reporting devices over time, as well as how many registered devices are {currently?} reporting data. We consider device "usage" to mean {whatever--logged in? online? powered on? apps active?}

We categorize the usage level with these terms:

- Active: at least 55 hours of usage
- Low: between 8 and 55 hours of usage
- Inactive: less than 8 hours of usage

This data is for the last 28 days.


## Application usage

The **Application usage** area details the top {how many?} applications in order of usage and their respective hours of usage for your managed devices. It also shows the total number of managed devices using a given application. Select **Search** to find a specific application if it isn't already listed.


## Device details
The detail area provides information on specific devices, including total device hours and number of active days over the time period. Use the filters to limit the view to those devices with a “Active”, “Inactive”, or “Low” usage pattern or “Not Reporting”.
