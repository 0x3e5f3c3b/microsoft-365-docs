# Enable features for customers

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse allows you to manage multiple tenants in a single view. For certain workflows to light up such as Device Compliance you will need to ensure you have followed the correct steps in enabling these features to work.  

Before you begin 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium Subscription 

Enabling Devices 

To be able to get the most value out of the Device compliance views in M365 Lighthouse,  

1. Ensure you have the devices in your tenants enrolled into MEM and 

2. You have compliance policies assigned to the devices.  

Enabling Users 

For the Users section in M365 Lighthouse, below are the licensing pre-requisites: 

1. For the 'Search Users' page, there are no license restrictions, and you can search for users across your tenants from here and perform basic operations on them like resetting a password. 

2. For all the other pages including Risky users, Multi-factor authentication and Password reset, ensure your tenants have Azure AD Premium P1 or above licenses for data show up on the reports. 

Enabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus  

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is part of the operating system and is enabled on devices that are running Windows 10. However, if you're using a non-Microsoft antivirus solution and not Microsoft Defender antivirus, then Microsoft Defender Antivirus automatically goes into disabled mode.  
 
When the non-Microsoft antivirus solution is uninstalled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus will automatically go into active mode to protect your Windows devices from threats.
