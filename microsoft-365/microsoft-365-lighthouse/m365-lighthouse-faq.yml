    questions:
      - question: What is Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is an admin portal that helps Managed Service Providers (MSPs) secure and manage devices, data, and users at scale for small- and medium-sized business (SMB) customers who are using Microsoft 365 Business Premium.  Microsoft 365 Lighthouse simplifies onboarding of tenants by recommending security configuration baselines tailored to SMBs and providing multi-tenant views across all customer environments. For more information, see [Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](overview-m365-lighthouse.md).
          
      - question: What's the difference between Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and Azure Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is focused on Microsoft 365 services rather than Azure services. While Azure Lighthouse is built into the Azure portal and allows you to manage multiple tenants for Azure, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is a standalone portal that helps you manage multiple Microsoft 365 Business Premium customer tenants. For more information about Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, see [Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](overview-m365-lighthouse.md). For more information about Azure Lighthouse, see [What is Azure Lighthouse](/azure/lighthouse/overview).
          
      - question: How much does Microsoft 365 Lighthouse cost?
        answer: |
          No additional costs are associated with using Microsoft 365 Lighthouse to manage Microsoft 365 Business Premium services and connected devices. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is currently in Preview and available to Managed Service Providers (MSPs) servicing small- to medium-sized businesses and who have a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) relationship with their customers. Note that indirect providers are not supported by Microsoft 365 Lighthouse at this time. For more information, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](sign-up-m365-lighthouse.md).
          
      - question: How do I sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          To sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, you'll need to be registered with the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. We're currently unable to support indirect providers. For instructions on how to sign up, see [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](sign-up-m365-lighthouse.md). To learn more about the CSP program, see the [Cloud Solution Provider program overview](/partner-center/csp-overview).
          
      - question: I finished signing up, so why don't I see any data?
        answer: |
          It can take up to 48 hours for your data to load within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. If it's been more than 48 hours since you completed onboarding, please reach out to our Support team for help. You'll need to let them know when you completed onboarding and provide any relevant screenshots and logs. For more information, see [Get help and support for Microsoft 365 Lighthouse]().
          
      - question: Why do I see some tenants but not others?
        answer: |
          For tenants to be active within Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, partners must establish Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP) with customers through Partner Center. For more information, see [Obtain permissions to manage a customer's service or subscription](/partner-center/customers-revoke-admin-privileges). Tenants also must have at least one Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription and fewer than 500 licensed users in their tenant.
          
      - question: What if I don't want to see certain tenants in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse?
        answer: |
          If you don't want to see certain tenants and their data in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse, you can inactivate those tenants. To inactivate a tenant, follow these steps:
          
          1. Select **Tenants** from the left navigation pane to open the **Tenants** page.
          1. Find the tenant that you want to inactivate, select the three dots next to the tenant name, and then select **Inactivate tenant**.
          1. In the confirmation message that appears, select **Confirm** to inactivate the tenant.
              > [!NOTE]
              > Once you inactivate a tenant, you'll be unable to take action on the tenant until inactivation is complete.
          
          To learn more about tenants, see [Overview of tenants]().
      - question: Will Microsoft 365 Lighthouse work if I have other subscriptions in my tenant besides Microsoft 365 Business Premium?
        answer: |
          Yes, Microsoft 365 Lighthouse will work as long as you meet all the other Microsoft 365 Lighthouse requirements; however, some functionality may be limited. For example, if a user is missing a license for Intune, that user's devices, device compliance status, and threats status will be unavailable. For more information, see [Requirements to use Microsoft 365 Lighthouse]().
