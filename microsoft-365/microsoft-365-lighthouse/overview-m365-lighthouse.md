# Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse is a new portal service that gives managed service providers the ability to onboard, monitor, and manage your Microsoft 365 customers and users from a single location. Microsoft 365 Lighthouse allows an admin to manage device compliance, threat protection, and user access for multiple tenants. 

## Standardize device compliance

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse allows you to monitor and manage device compliance for all of your customers from a central location. An overall view of device policies and statuses across tenants allows you to make comparisons and standardize your work with customers. 

## Manage antivirus and threat protection

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse threat management capabilities give you a view into the protection status of Microsoft Defender Antivirus across all Windows 10 devices under your management. You can determine which devices in your business are running Defender Antivirus, whether those devices are up to date, whether they have active threats, and where a reboot, required update, or an overdue scan is necessary. You're also able to view active threats in your environment, determine which users and devices are affected and which were blocked or quarantined and where further review is needed.

## Manage user access

A single list of all of the users you manage across your customer base lets you perform user access tasks automatically, including password resets, assigning licenses, blocking access, changing group memberships, and delegating access to a mailbox or OneDrive without having to log in and out of multiple customer tenants. 

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse provides tracing and auditing for all user access actions performed in the portal. 


## Next steps

<!-- Include this section for how-to articles only, if needed. Next logical action might be to enable features for customers, but I'm not certain of that. Next steps seem appropriate, especially for a new service overview. LMK what you think is the appropriate how-to article for this section. -->
