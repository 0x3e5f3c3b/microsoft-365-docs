# Scheduler for Microsoft 365 FAQ's

**Question:** Can I use the other features of Cortana with Scheduler?
No. Scheduler only interacts with email via the cortana@contoso.com/cortana@yourdomain.com address. As a result, Scheduler works on any device where email is available. Scheduler is technically an Exchange service and not a Cortana service.

**Question:** Does this work only with Outlook? Are other email products supported?  
As long as you have a license, Other than the three requirements above, users can email cortana@contoso.com from any email client and any device.

**Question:** Can contacts be in a personal contact list on Outlook as well as GAL or other company equivalent?
Meeting attendees can be anyone with an email address inside or outside the company. Unfortunately, Scheduler cannot automatically translate names to email addresses / alias by looking it up in the GAL today.

**Question:** Can I use this with my installed version (on-premises) version of Outlook ?
Scheduler is for Exchange Online only. It does not work with on-premises calendars.

**Question:** Does Outlook have to be open in the background?
Outlook does not need to be open in the background. All you need to do is send Cortana a mail and rely on it to do the bulk of the work.
