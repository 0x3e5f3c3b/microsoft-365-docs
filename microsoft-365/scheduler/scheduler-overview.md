# Welcome to Scheduler for Microsoft 365

Scheduler for Microsoft 365 is a service that enables users to delegate meeting and appointment scheduling to their digital personal assistant, Cortana. Scheduler uses natural language processing to interpret emails sent to Cortana (cortana@yourdomain.com) to find a time to meet and send meeting requests for the meeting organizer.  

Scheduler: 

- Communicates with the meeting organizer and attendees in natural language.
- Finds a time to meet when everyone is available.
- Coordinates between external attendees based on the organizer’s availability.
- Keeps the meeting organizer informed on scheduling progress and asks the organizer for guidance when needed 
- Negotiates times to meet across up to two different time zones 
- Sends the invitation to the meeting 
- Adds a Teams link to every meeting  
- Reschedules or cancels meetings booked by Cortana 
- Works from any device with email  

## Who can benefit from Scheduler for Microsoft 365?

Scheduler takes care of the time-consuming hassle of scheduling meetings so that users can focus on more important things. People that regularly schedule meetings with 5 or fewer attendees will benefit from Scheduler’s time savings. Specifically, users in recruiting, sales, procurement, and legal that require coordinating with others outside of their company will receive the most value from delegating meeting coordination to Scheduler.

## How does Scheduler for Microsoft 365 work?

Scheduler uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Human intelligence to complete scheduling requests that are received by emailing Cortana (Cortana@yourdomain.com).  

To use Scheduler, add Cortana’s email address to an email with the people you want to meet with and ask Cortana to book a meeting in natural language. In your request to Cortana, you can indicate the duration and when you want to meet. For example, “Cortana, find 45 minutes for us to meet next week.” 

After a user sends a meeting request to Cortana, the Scheduler service: 

- Finds a time to meet based on the availability information of the organizer and attendees in the same tenant.
- If the organizer does not have access to availability information of the attendees, Cortana negotiates with those attendees to find a time that works based on the availability information it has access to (typically the organizer and internal attendees’ availability). 
- Once the mutually agreeable time has been found, Cortana sends out the invites and adds a Teams Meeting.
