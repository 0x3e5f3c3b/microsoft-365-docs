# Analyze automated investigations

**Applies to**:
- Microsoft 365

When an automated investigation is underway or has completed, you can view details and results of the investigation. To do that, you can use [the automated investigations dashboard](autoir-dashboard-overview.md). You can also conduct further analysis on entities, alerts, or incidents, and see your recommended next steps.

Here are some examples of analysis that can be done with automated investigations in the Microsoft 365 security center:
- Investigate an alert that isn't suitable for automated investigation
- Examine malware that was detected in email or on a user's machine
- Find out when a user account was compromised
- Determine whether a URL switched from safe to malicious
- ... and more.
