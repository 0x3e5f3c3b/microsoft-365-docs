# Analyze automated investigations

**Applies to**:
- Microsoft 365

When an automated investigation is underway or has completed, you can view details and results of the investigation. To do that, you can use [the automated investigations dashboard](autoir-dashboard-overview.md). You can also conduct further analysis on entities or incidents,and if necessary, engage in [hunting for malware and other threats](hunting.md). 

Here are some examples of analysis that can be done with automated investigations in the Microsoft 365 security center:
- Examine malware that was detected in email or on a user's machine
- Find out when a user account was compromised
- Determine whether a URL switched from safe to malicious
- ... and more.
