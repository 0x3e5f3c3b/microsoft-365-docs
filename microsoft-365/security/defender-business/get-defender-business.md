# Get Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!TIP]
> If your company is a small or midsized business (300 or fewer users) and you would like to sign up for the Microsoft Defender for Business preview program, visit [https://aka.ms/MDBPreview](https://aka.ms/MDBPreview).

If you donâ€™t already have Microsoft Defender for Business, you can choose from several options:

- Sign up for the preview program
- [Work with a Microsoft solution provider](#work-with-a-microsoft-solution-provider)
- [Get Microsoft Defender for Business on your own](#get-microsoft-defender-for-business-on-your-own)


## Sign up for the preview program

## Work with a Microsoft Solution Provider

Microsoft has a list of solution providers who are authorized to sell offerings, such as Microsoft Defender for Business. 

To find a solution provider in your area, take the following steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft Solution Providers page ([https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers)).
 
2. In the search box, fill in your location and company size. In the **Search for products, services, skills, industries** box, put `Microsoft 365`, and then select **Go**.

3. Review the list of results. Select a provider to learn more about their expertise and the services they provide.

## Get Microsoft Defender for Business on your own 

If you prefer to get Microsoft Defender for Business directly, keep in mind that the first person to sign your company up is a global administrator (also referred as the global admin). The global admin can purchase licenses, upgrade services, set up user accounts, and configure settings for your organization. 

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

2. In the navigation bar, go to **Billing**. 

3. To view your current subscription(s), select **Your products**.

4. To add a subscription, such as Microsoft Defender for Business, choose **Purchase services**. Search for *Microsoft Defender for Business*, and then complete the purchase or trial process.
