# Get Microsoft Defender for business

If you donâ€™t already have Microsoft Defender for business, you can choose from several options:

- [Work with a Microsoft solution provider](#work-with-a-microsoft-solution-provider)
- [Get Microsoft Defender for business on your own](#get-microsoft-defender-for-business-on-your-own) by signing up for a free trial or purchasing a subscription

## Work with a Microsoft Solution Provider

Microsoft has a list of solution providers who are authorized to sell offerings, such as Microsoft Defender for business. 

To find a solution provider in your area, take the following steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft Solution Providers page ([https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers)).
 
2. In the search box, fill in your location and company size. In the Search for products, services, skills, industries box, put `Microsoft 365`, and then select **Go**.

3. Review the list of results. Select a provider to learn more about their expertise and the services they provide.

> [!TIP]
> If you decide to purchase Microsoft Defender for business through a solution provider, the provider can help with all of your setup and configuration steps.

## Get Microsoft Defender for business on your own 

If you prefer to get Microsoft Defender for business directly, the first person to sign your company up is a global administrator (also referred as the global admin). The global admin can purchase licenses, upgrade services, set up user accounts, and configure settings for your organization. 

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

2. In the navigation bar, go to **Billing**. 

3. To view your current subscription(s), select **Your products**.

4. To add a subscription, such as Microsoft Defender for business, choose **Purchase services**. Search for *Microsoft Defender for business*, and then complete the purchase or trial process.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about the process of purchasing a Microsoft 365 subscription, see [Try or buy a Microsoft 365 for business subscription](../../commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md).
