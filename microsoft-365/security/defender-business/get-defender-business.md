# Get Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Defender for Business is now in preview, and will roll out gradually to customers and IT Partners who [sign-up here](https://aka.ms/mdb-preview) to request it.

Microsoft Defender for Business (preview) is available in preview! Participating in the preview program enables you to try out Defender for Business before it becomes generally available. The preview program is available to:

- Microsoft partners who provide IT services to small and medium-sized businesses
- Small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees)

## Sign up for the preview program

1. Visit [https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview).

2. Select **Customer** or **Microsoft Partner**.

3. Review and accept the terms of the Microsoft Defender for Business Preview Agreement, and then choose **Next**.

4. Fill out the form with your contact information. 

   - If you're a customer who is working with a Microsoft partner, in the **Other** box, fill in the organization name of the partner. Then choose **Submit**.
   - If you're a Microsoft partner, make sure to indicate your partnership type and information about customers you're planning to work with.

5. When you have finished filling out the form, choose **Submit**.

## What to expect after applying

We'll review your application and make a determination. You'll then receive an email that either includes your promo code or that explains why we're not able to offer you the trial program at this time.

If you're accepted, your email will contain a license code that you'll use to activate your Defender for Business trial.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're a partner, after you have been accepted into the preview program, you must have each customer complete the process described in the section, [Sign up for the preview program](#sign-up-for-the-preview-program). Make sure the customer specifies your Microsoft partner name in the **Other** box.

## Two portals for setup

When you're ready to start your trial, you'll work with two main portals to get things set up. The following table summarizes the two main portals you'll use: <br/><br/>

|Portal  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| The Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/))      | Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to add or remove users, assign user licenses, view your products and services, and complete setup tasks for your Microsoft 365 subscription. <br/><br/> To learn more, see [Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview.md).      |
| The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com))     | Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage security settings for email protection and for your organization's devices. <br/><br/>To learn more, see [Get started using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](mdb-get-started.md).        |

If your organization is using Microsoft Intune (part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager) to manage devices, you might also use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com/](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/)). To learn more, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).

## View and manage users

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/)) and sign in using the same account you used to request your trial subscription.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** > **Active users**. Review the list of users. 

3. To add users, follow the guidance in [Add users and assign licenses at the same time](../../admin/add-users/add-users.md).

Now you're ready to proceed to [Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-setup-configuration.md).
