# Choose where to manage your policies and settings

You can manage your security policies and settings in Microsoft Defender for business using one of two methods/locations:

- (*Recommended*) The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com))
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)). Endpoint Manager now includes Microsoft Intune.

When you begin to use Microsoft Defender for business, you will be asked whether you want to use Endpoint Manager or your Microsoft 365 Defender portal. We recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and its wizard-like experience for managing your devices and security settings. 

### Why we recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage your security solution

Microsoft Defender for business is designed to provide strong protection while saving you time and effort in configuring your security settings. The streamlined experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal makes it simple to onboard devices and manage them. In addition, default policies are included so that your company's devices are protected as soon as they are onboarded. You can keep your default settings as they are, or make changes to suit your business needs. You can also add new policies to manage devices.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedures included in this article assume that you are using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage your companyâ€™s security settings.
