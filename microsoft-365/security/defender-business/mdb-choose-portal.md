# Choose where to manage your policies and settings

When it comes to configuring your security features on your companyâ€™s devices, you can choose from one of two portals: the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal and the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. 

When you begin to use Microsoft Defender for Business, you will be asked which portal you want to use. You'll be asked only once. We recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The following table describes each portal:

| Portal  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <p>*Recommended*    | The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is where you'll view and manage incidents, respond to and mitigate threats, view reports, review pending or completed actions, and more. This portal is your one-stop shop for your company's security settings and threat protection capabilities. Plus, you get a simplified experience to help you get started quickly and efficiently.        |
|Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)) <p>*Endpoint Manager now includes Microsoft Intune*     | Microsoft Endpoint Manager includes Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for apps and devices. Many enterprise organizations use Intune to manage devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. To learn more, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).       |


> [!TIP]
> We recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and its wizard-like experience for using and managing Defender for Business. 

## Why we recommend using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to manage your security solution

Microsoft Defender for Business is designed to provide strong protection while saving you time and effort in configuring your security settings. The streamlined experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal makes it simple to onboard devices and manage them. In addition, default policies are included so that your company's devices are protected as soon as they are onboarded. You can keep your default settings as they are, or make changes to suit your business needs. You can also add new policies to manage devices.

## What if you change your mind?

If you have chosen a portal and change your mind later, contact support. They'll help you make the switch to the other portal.
