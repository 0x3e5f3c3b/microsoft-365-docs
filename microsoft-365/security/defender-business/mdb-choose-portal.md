# Choose where to manage your policies and settings

When it comes to onboarding devices and configuring security settings for your companyâ€™s devices, you can use one of two portals experiences: 
- The simplified configuration process in Microsoft Defender for Business; or 
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM), which includes Microsoft Intune. 

**We recommend using the simplified configuration process in Microsoft Defender for Business**, even if you are already using MEM. The simplified configuration process is streamlined especially for small and midsized businesses and is designed to protect your company's devices from day one.

The following table describes each experience:

<br/><br/>

| Portal  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|The simplified configuration experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) <br/><br/>*Recommended*    | The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is where you'll view and manage incidents, respond to and mitigate threats, view reports, review pending or completed actions, and more. This portal is your one-stop shop for your company's security settings and threat protection capabilities. Plus, you get a simplified experience to help you get started quickly and efficiently. <br/><br/>The simplified configuration experience includes default security settings and policies that are based on industry best practices. These default security settings and policies can help you protect your company's devices from day one. And, you can edit your settings or define new policies to suit your company's needs.       |
|The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center ([https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)) <br/><br/>*Endpoint Manager now includes Microsoft Intune*     | Microsoft Endpoint Manager includes Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for apps and devices. Many enterprise organizations use Intune to manage devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. To learn more, see [Microsoft Intune is an MDM and MAM provider for your devices](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).       |


## Why we recommend using the simplified configuration experience

Microsoft Defender for Business is designed to provide strong protection while saving you time and effort in configuring your security settings. The streamlined experience in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal makes it simple to onboard devices and manage them. In addition, default policies are included so that your company's devices are protected as soon as they are onboarded. You can keep your default settings as they are, or make changes to suit your business needs. You can also add new policies to manage devices as needed.

## What if you change your mind?

If you have chosen a portal and change your mind later, contact support. They'll help you make the switch to the other portal.
