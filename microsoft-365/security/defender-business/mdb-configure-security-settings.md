After you have onboarded your company's devices to Microsoft Defender for Business, you next step is to view and if necessary, edit your security settings and policies. 

## What to do

1. 

## Choose where to manage your security settings and policies

You can choose from several options, as described in the following table: <br/><br/>

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Use the default security settings and policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal** (recommended) | Defender for Business was designed for the busy small or medium-sized business in mind. The default security settings and policies in Defender for Business are designed to protect your company's devices from day one.<br/><br/>You can use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com/](https://security.microsoft.com/)) to manage your security settings and policies.<br/><br/>To learn more, see [View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-view-edit-device-policies.md). |
| **Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager** | If your company is using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage security settings and policies, you can continue using Endpoint Manager and apply security policies and settings to some or all devices. To learn more, see [Manage device security with endpoint security policies in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security-policy). <br/><br/>Consider switching to the [simplified configuration process in Defender for Business](mdb-simplified-configuration.md). If you make the switch, you'll be prompted to delete any existing security policies in Microsoft Endpoint Manager before proceeding with the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business. Deleting your policies in Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps avoid policy conflicts later. |
