# Configure your security settings and policies in Microsoft Defender for Business

After you have onboarded your company's devices to Microsoft Defender for Business, you next step is to configure your security settings and policies. You can choose from two main options:

- Use the default security settings and policies in Microsoft Defender for Business (recommended); or 
- Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM)

## Use the default security settings and policies in Defender for Business

Defender for Business was designed for the busy small or midsized business in mind. You can use the default security settings and policies that are preconfigured to protect your company's devices from day one.

If your company is not already using MEM, your devices are protected by the default policies as soon as they are onboarded. See 
[View or edit device policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-view-edit-device-policies.md).

## Use MEM to configure security settings and policies

If your company is using MEM to manage security settings and policies, you can choose to apply security policies and settings to all or some devices.

You can also opt to switch to the [simplified configuration process in Defender for Business](mdb-choose-portal.md). In this case, you'll be prompted to delete existing security policies in MEM before using the simplified configuration process in Defender for Business.
