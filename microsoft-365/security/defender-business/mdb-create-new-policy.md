# Create a new policy in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Defender for Business is now in preview, and will roll out gradually to customers and IT Partners who [sign-up here](https://aka.ms/mdb-preview) to request it. We will onboard an initial set of customers and partners in the coming weeks and will expand the preview leading up to general availability. Note that preview will launch with an [initial set of scenarios](mdb-tutorials.md#try-these-preview-scenarios), and we will be adding capabilities regularly.

Microsoft Defender for Business (preview) includes default policies that use recommended settings to protect your company's devices from day one. For example, you have **Next-generation protection** policies and **Firewall** policies that are built in using recommended security settings. But you're not limited to your default policies. You can create new policies, too, as described in this article.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to edit an existing policy, see [View or edit policies in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-view-edit-policies.md).

## Create a new policy

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and sign in. 

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. Under **Next-generation protection** or **Firewall**, select **+ Add**.

5. On the **General information** tab, take the following steps:

   1. Specify a name and description. This information will help you and your team identify the policy later on.
   2. Review the policy order, and edit it if necessary. (For more information, see [Policy order](mdb-policy-order.md).)
   3. Choose **Next**. 

7. On the **Device groups** tab, either create a new device group, or use an existing group. Policies are assigned to devices through device groups. Here are some things to keep in mind:

   - Initially, you might only have your default device group, which includes the devices people in your company are using to access company data and email. You can keep and use your default device group.
   - Create a new device group to apply a policy with specific settings that are different from the default policy. 
   - When you set up your device group, you specify certain criteria, such as the operating system version. Devices that meet the criteria are included in that device group, unless you exclude them. 
   - All device groups, including the default and custom device groups that you define, are stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

   To learn more about device groups, see [Device groups in Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-create-edit-device-groups.md).

8. On the **Configuration settings** tab, specify the settings for your policy, and then choose **Next**. For more information about the individual settings, see [Configuration settings for Microsoft Defender for Business (preview)](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md).

9. On the **Review your policy** tab, review the general information, targeted devices, and configuration settings. 

   - Make any needed changes by selecting **Edit**.
   - When youâ€™re ready to proceed, choose **Create policy**.
