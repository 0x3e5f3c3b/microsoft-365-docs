Set up email notifications for your security team. Then, as alerts are generated, or new vulnerabilities are discovered, people on your security team will be notified automatically. 

Email notifications are not the only way your security team can find out about new alerts or vulnerabilities. Whenever your security team signs into the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), they'll see cards highlighting new threats, alerts, and vulnerabilities. Email notifications are an additional way to keep your security team informed, in real time.

Typically, email notifications are set up during the initial setup and configuration process for Microsoft Defender for Business:
