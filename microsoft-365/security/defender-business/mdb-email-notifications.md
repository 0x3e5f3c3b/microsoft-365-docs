# Set up email notifications

You can set up email notifications for your security team. Then, as alerts are generated, or new vulnerabilities are discovered, people on your security team will be notified automatically.

You can choose from two types of notifications, as described in the following table: <br/><br/>


| Notification type  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| Vulnerabilities  | Whenever any new exploits or vulnerability events are detected, recipients receive an email. |
| Alerts & vulnerabilities  | When alerts are generated because threats are detected on devices, or when any new exploits or vulnerability events are detected, recipients receive an email. |


- **Vulnerabilities** - email notifications about new exploits or vulnerability events
- **Alerts & vulnerabilities** - email notifications about alerts on devices, new exploits, or vulnerability events

**Email notifications are not the only way your security team can find out about new alerts or vulnerabilities**. Whenever your security team signs into the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), they'll see cards highlighting new threats, alerts, and vulnerabilities. Your security team can also choose **Incidents** in the navigation pane to view information. Email notifications are another way to help keep your security team informed, in real time.

## View and edit email notifications

To view or edit email notification settings for your company, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. In the navigation pane, select **Settings**, and then select **Endpoints**. Then, under **General**, select **Email notifications**. 

3. Review the information on the **Alerts** and **Vulnerabilities** tabs.

   - If you don't see any items listed on the **Alerts** tab, you can create a rule for people to be notified when alerts are generated. To get help with this task, see [Create rules for alert notifications](../defender-endpoint/configure-email-notifications.md).

   - If you don't see any items listed on the **Vulnerabilities** tab, you can create a rule for people to be notified whenever a new vulnerability is discovered. To get help with this task, see [Create rules for vulnerability events](../defender-endpoint/configure-vulnerability-email-notifications.md).

   - If you do have rules created, select a rule to edit it. You can also delete a rule.
