# Microsoft Defender for Business - Frequently asked questions and answers

## I have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Why am I not seeing Microsoft Defender for Business in my portal?

Currently, whenever a customer has multiple subscriptions, the highest subscription takes precedence. For example, if a customer has Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 and Microsoft Defender for Business, Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 takes precedence. In this case, the customer will not see the Defender for Business experience.

## What are the differences between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plans 1 and 2?

See [Compare Microsoft Defender for Business to Microsoft 365 Business Premium](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md)

## How do I sign up for the preview of Defender for Business?

Visit [https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview) to apply for the preview program.

## Are there any prerequisites for Defender for Business preview?

Your company should be one of the following:

Customers and partners who sign up for the preview program will be able to try out Microsoft Defender for Business for 90 days for free.
