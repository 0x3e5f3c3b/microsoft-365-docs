    questions:

      - question: How do I try or buy Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Go to the [Defender for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-business) web page, and select the option to try or buy Defender for Business.

          For more information, see [Get Defender for Business](get-defender-business.md).

      - question: Is there a limit to how many users can be licensed for Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Defender for Business is designed for small and medium-sized businesses who have up to 300 users. If you have more than 300 users, consider an enterprise solution, such as one of the following:
          
          - [Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint)
          - [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender)
          - [Microsoft 365 for enterprise](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-overview)

      - question: How many devices can I onboard and secure with Defender for Business? 
        answer: |
          You can onboard and secure up to five client devices per user license.
          
      - question: Does Defender for Business protect Mac, Android, and iOS/iPadOS client devices?
        answer: |
          Yes. Defender for Business supports protection for Mac, Android, and iOS/iPadOS devices. See [Onboard devices](mdb-onboard-devices.md).

          - You can onboard Mac devices using a local script in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. 
          - To onboard Android and iOS/iPadOS devices, you can use [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/).

          More simplification for Mac, iOS/iPadOS, and Android devices is on the roadmap. 

      - question: Does Defender for Business support servers? 
        answer: |
          Server support is now in preview! See [How to get Microsoft Defender for Business servers (preview)](get-defender-business-servers.md).  

          When the Microsoft Defender for Business servers license becomes generally available (GA), it will be offered as an add-on to Microsoft 365 Business Premium and the standalone version of Defender for Business. At GA, Microsoft Defender for Business servers will be priced at $3 per server instance. At that point, you can either purchase a license for each onboarded server, or choose to offboard servers from Defender for Business.

          If you have more than 60 servers, you'll need to get Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2.

      - question: What is the difference between Microsoft Defender for Business servers and Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Defender for Business servers is an add-on to Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium only. The Microsoft Defender for Business servers license enables you to manage security for both client devices and servers within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). With a simplified configuration process and device onboarding options, Defender for Business enables customers who don't necessarily have a security background to set up, configure, and use Defender for Servers or Defender for Cloud to protect company devices. Defender for Business is designed for businesses with up to 300 employees (supporting up to 1500 client devices). Microsoft Defender for Business servers supports up to 60 servers. 
          
          You're not limited to 60 servers with Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2. Defender for Servers Plan 1/Plan 2 is an enterprise-focused offering that can be purchased with any other Microsoft cloud plan. This offering is part of the [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) offering. The admin experience for Defender for Cloud resides within the Azure portal ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)). Advanced threat hunting with six months of data retention and the Microsoft Threat Experts service are available with Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2.

      - question: Can I configure more than one web content filtering policy in Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Currently, Defender for Business supports only one uniform web filtering policy per Defender for Business tenant. 
          
          See [Set up web content filtering](mdb-configure-security-settings.md#set-up-web-content-filtering).

      - question: Can I use non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware software with Defender for Business? 
        answer: |
          Although you can technically onboard devices that are running a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware solution, you could run into an issue where real-time protection could be turned off on those devices. If real-time protection is turned off on a device, the device will appear to be not protected. 
          
          In Defender for Business, real-time protection is turned on by default; however, devices running non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware software could affect your settings. 
          
          To learn more, see [I'm seeing indications that some devices aren't protected even though they're onboarded to Defender for Business](mdb-troubleshooting.yml#i-m-seeing-indications-that-some-devices-aren-t-protected-even-though-they-re-onboarded-to-defender-for-business).

      - question: How do I run custom reports with Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Defender for Business currently includes a set of APIs to support robust custom reporting, and a Power BI connector. You could schedule a PowerShell script to generate executive summaries formatted in HTML, and send those summaries via email. See [API reference information](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exposed-apis-create-app-partners). Also see [Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft partner resources](mdb-partners.md).

      - question: I'm a Microsoft partner. Will I be able to manage multiple tenants from one control panel, or will I have to sign in to each tenant individually? 
        answer: |

          Several options are available, including Microsoft 365 Lighthouse and using APIs to integrate with your tools. See [Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft partner resources](mdb-partners.md).

          - Defender for Business integrates with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for multi-tenant support in a single console ([https://lighthouse.microsoft.com](https://lighthouse.microsoft.com)). See [Overview of Microsoft 365 Lighthouse](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-overview).
          - You can use the Defender for Endpoint APIs to integrate Defender for Business with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and your professional service automation (PSA) software. See [Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft partner resources](mdb-partners.md).

      - question: How do I configure attack surface reduction rules and capabilities in Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Simplified configuration for attack surface reduction rules and capabilities via Defender for Business in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) isn't supported yet. You can use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to configure your attack surface reduction policies. See [Attack surface reduction policy for endpoint security in Intune](/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy).

      - question: How does Microsoft Intune work with Defender for Business? 
        answer: |
          If you have Defender for Business as a standalone subscription, you can onboard and secure Windows and Mac devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)). You can use Microsoft Intune to onboard Windows and Mac computers as well as mobile devices.

          When you enroll devices in Intune and onboard those devices to Defender for Business, you create a connection between Intune and Defender for Business.
           
          You can manage your next-generation protection and firewall protection policies in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal with a [simplified configuration experience](mdb-simplified-configuration.md). These policies are visible in Intune. To manage other settings, such as attack surface reduction policies, you'll use Intune.  

      - question: If I'm already using Microsoft 365 Business Premium, why do I need Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          If you have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, then you already have Defender for Business. To learn more, see the following articles:
           
          - [Overview of Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md)
          - [Compare Defender for Business to Microsoft 365 Business Premium](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md)
          - [Compare Microsoft endpoint security plans](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2)
          
          Defender for Business extends security capabilities in Microsoft 365 Business Premium with endpoint protection for your company's devices.

      - question: What are the differences between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plans 1 and 2?
        answer: |
          Both Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint provide strong threat protection capabilities for your company's endpoints. Defender for Business was designed for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). With a [simplified configuration process](mdb-simplified-configuration.md) and [device onboarding options](mdb-onboard-devices.md), Defender for Business enables customers who don't necessarily have a security background to set up, configure, and use Defender for Business to protect company devices.  
          
          To learn more about the differences, see [Compare Microsoft endpoint security plans](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2).

      - question: What happens if I have a mix of Microsoft endpoint security subscriptions? 
        answer: |
          *Suppose you have assigned 10 users a Defender for Business license, and you have assigned 10 other users a Defender for Endpoint Plan license. What happens if you have a mix of subscriptions like this example in your tenant?*

          Currently, a tenant with Defender for Business will default to the Defender for Business experience, tenant wide, even if you have Defender for Endpoint licenses in your tenant. 

          If you have a mix of Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plan licenses, all users and onboarded devices will receive Defender for Business capabilities. Note that Defender for Business was designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses, and includes more security features and capabilities than Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (standalone). For more information, see [Compare Microsoft endpoint security plans](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2).

          For more information about licenses and product terms, see [Licensing and product terms for Microsoft 365 subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/Microsoft365/MCA).

      - question: My organization has grown to more than 300 employees, and I have a mix of Microsoft endpoint security subscriptions. Can I still use Defender for Business?   
        answer: |  
          *Suppose your company has grown from 250 users to 330 users, and you now have a mix of Microsoft endpoint security subscriptions, such as 300 Defender for Business licenses and 30 Microsoft 365 E3 licenses.*

          [Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md) and [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](/microsoft-365/business-premium/) are for customers who have up to 300 users. If you now have more than 300 users, we recommend getting a subscription that includes [Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-plan-1-2) for all users. However, we understand that there are scenarios where a customer grows to more than 300 users within a license term. 
          
          Referring to our example, suppose you started your license term with 250 Defender for Business licenses, and now you have 300 Defender for Business licenses and 30 Microsoft 365 E3 licenses (Microsoft 365 E3 includes Defender for Endpoint Plan 1). Defender for Business features and capabilities will apply tenant wide. When it's time to renew your subscription, we recommend choosing an enterprise plan, such as one of the following subscriptions:

          - [Microsoft 365 E5](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/E5) (includes Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 plus Defender for Office 365 Plan 2)
          - [Microsoft 365 E3](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/E3) (includes Defender for Endpoint Plan 1)
          - [Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or 2](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/endpoint-defender)

          For more information, see [Compare security plans for small and medium-sized businesses](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md).

          For details about licenses and product terms, see [Licensing and product terms for Microsoft 365 subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/Microsoft365/MCA).
       
      - question: How do I view my organization's Microsoft subscriptions and user licenses?
        answer: |
          You can view your current subscriptions and licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center ([https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)). Choose **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Licenses**.

          Also see [Understand subscriptions and licenses in Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/subscriptions-and-licenses).
