title: Microsoft Defender for Business - Frequently asked questions and answers
summary: |

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: I have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Why am I not seeing Microsoft Defender for Business in my portal?
        answer: |
          Currently, whenever a customer has multiple subscriptions, the highest subscription takes precedence. For example, if a customer has Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 and Microsoft Defender for Business, Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 takes precedence. In this case, the customer will not see the Defender for Business experience.

      - question: What are the differences between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plans 1 and 2?
        answer: |
          Defender for Business was designed for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). With a [simplified configuration process](mdb-simplified-configuration.md) and several device onboarding options, Defender for Business enables customers who do not necessarily have a security background to set up, configure, and use Defender for Business.  
          
          Both Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint provide strong threat protection capabilities for your company's endpoints. To learn more about the differences, see [Compare Microsoft Defender for Business to Microsoft 365 Business Premium](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md).

      - question: How do I sign up for the preview of Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Visit [https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview) to apply for the preview program.

      - question: Are there any prerequisites for Defender for Business preview?
        answer: |
          Your company should be one of the following:
          - A partner who offers IT services to small and medium-sized businesses
          - A small or medium-sized business with up to 300 employees

          You do not already have to have another Microsoft 365 subscription.

          See [Microsoft Defender for Business requirements](mdb-requirements.md).

      - question: What will the licensing model be at GA?
        answer: |
          When Microsoft Defender for Business reaches general availability (GA), it will be included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

          For customers who do not have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Defender for Business will be available as a standalone plan. 

      - question: If I am already using Microsoft 365 Business Premium, why do I need Defender for Business?
        answer: |
           Microsoft 365 Business Premium currently includes Microsoft Defender Antivirus, next-generation protection for Windows devices. Defender for Business extends these capabilities with threat & vulnerability management, attack surface reduction capabilities, endpoint detection and response, and automated investigation and response.
