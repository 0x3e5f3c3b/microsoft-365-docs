title: Microsoft Defender for Business - Frequently asked questions and answers
summary: |

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: I have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Why am I not seeing Microsoft Defender for Business in my portal?
        answer: |
          Currently, whenever a customer has multiple subscriptions, the highest subscription takes precedence. For example, if a customer has Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 and Microsoft Defender for Business, Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 takes precedence. In this case, the customer will not see the Defender for Business experience.

      - question: What are the differences between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint Plans 1 and 2?
        answer: |
          See [Compare Microsoft Defender for Business to Microsoft 365 Business Premium](compare-mdb-m365-plans.md).

      - question: How do I sign up for the preview of Defender for Business?
        answer: |
          Visit [https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview](https://aka.ms/MDB-Preview) to apply for the preview program.

      - question: Are there any prerequisites for Defender for Business preview?
        answer: |
          Your company should be one of the following:
          - A partner who offers IT services to small and medium-sized businesses
          - A small or medium-sized business with up to 300 employees

          You do not already have to have another Microsoft 365 subscription.

          See [Microsoft Defender for Business requirements](mdb-requirements.md).

      - question: What will be the licensing model at GA?
        answer: |
          When Microsoft Defender for Business reaches general availability (GA), it will be included in Microsoft 365 Business Premium.

          For customers who do not have Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Defender for Business will be available as a standalone plan.
