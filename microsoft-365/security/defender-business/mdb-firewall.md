# Firewall in Microsoft Defender for Business

Microsoft Defender for Business includes firewall capabilities with Windows Defender Firewall. Firewall protection helps secure devices with rules that determine which network traffic is permitted to enter devices and which network traffic is allowed to be sent from devices.

When your company's devices are onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Business, your default firewall policy wil allow all outbound connections from devices. Whether inbound connections are allowed or blocked depends on how your firewall settings are configured and your location.
