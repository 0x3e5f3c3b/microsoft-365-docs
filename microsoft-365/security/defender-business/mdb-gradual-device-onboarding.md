# Gradual device onboarding with Microsoft Defender for Business

If you are using Microsoft Intune (part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager) to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business, you can choose to onboard selected devices. We call this process gradual device onboarding.

## See how many devices are not onboarded yet

If you're using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage your devices, you'll have an Onboarding card in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The card shows the number of devices that are in use at your company, and how many of those devices are not onboarded yet.

To onboard more devices, select the **Onboard more devices** link in the card. This action takes you to Microsoft Endpoint Manager, where you can create a device configuration profile.
