# View or edit next-generation protection policies in Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information in this article relates to prereleased products/services that might be substantially modified before they are commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, for the information provided here. This article includes links to online content that might describe some features that are not included in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview).

Microsoft Defender for Business was designed to simplify setup, configuration, and management. Your Microsoft Defender for Business plan comes with default, next-generation protection policies that are based on Microsoft’s recommendations for security and productivity. You can view and edit your default policies, and you can define new policies. You can also change the order of priority for policies that you create. 

The following sections provide more information about your security policies in Microsoft Defender for Business:

- [View your policies](#view-your-policies)
- [Define a new policy](#define-a-new-policy)
- [Edit an existing policy](#edit-an-existing-policy)
- [Learn more about policy order](#what-about-policy-order)

## View your next-generation protection policies

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. You’re now in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. To view more details about a policy, select its name. A side pane will open that provides more information about that policy, such as which devices are protected by that policy.

## Edit an existing next-generation protection policy

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. You’re now in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. To edit a policy, select its name, and then choose **Edit**.

5. On the **General information** tab, review the information. If necessary, you can edit the description. Then choose **Next**.

6. On the **Device groups** tab, determine which device groups should receive this policy.  

   - To keep the selected device group as it is, choose **Next**.
   - To remove a device group from the policy, select **Remove**.
   - To set up a new device group, select **Create new group**, and then set up your device group. (To get help with this task, see [Add or remove devices from a group](mdb-manage-devices.md#add-or-remove-devices-from-a-group).)
   - To apply the policy to another device group, select **Use existing group**.

   After you have specified which device groups should receive the policy, choose **Next**.

7. On the **Configuration settings** tab, review the settings. If necessary, you can edit the settings for your policy. (To get help with this task, see [Understand next-generation configuration settings in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md).)

   After you have specified your next-generation protection settings, choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review your policy** tab, review the general information, targeted devices, and configuration settings. 

   - Make any needed changes by selecting **Edit**.
   - When you’re ready to proceed, choose **Update policy**.

## Define a new next-generation protection policy

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. You’re now in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. Under **Next-generation protection**, select **+ Add**.

5. On the **General information** tab, take the following steps:

   1. Specify a name and description. This information will help you and your team identify the policy later on.
   2. Review the policy order, and edit it if necessary. (For more information, see [Policy order](#what-about-policy-order).)
   3. Choose **Next**. 

7. On the **Device groups** tab, either create a new device group, or use an existing group. Policies are assigned to devices through device groups. Here are some things to keep in mind:

   - Initially, you might only have your default device group, which includes the devices people in your company are using to access company data and email.
   - Create a new device group to apply a policy with specific settings that are different from the default policy. 
   - When you set up your device group, you specify certain criteria, such as the operating system version. Devices that meet the criteria are included in that device group, unless you exclude them. 
   - All device groups—including the default and custom device groups that you define—are stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

8. On the **Configuration settings** tab, specify the settings for your policy, and then choose **Next**. For more information about the individual settings, see [Configuration settings for Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md).

9. On the **Review your policy** tab, review the general information, targeted devices, and configuration settings. 

   - Make any needed changes by selecting **Edit**.
   - When you’re ready to proceed, choose **Create policy**.

## What about policy order?

Microsoft Defender for Business includes predefined policies to help ensure the devices your employees use are protected. You can add new policies as well. For example, suppose that you want to apply certain settings to some devices, and different settings to other devices. You can do that by adding policies.

As you define policies, you’ll notice that an order of priority is assigned. You can edit the order of priority for the policies that you define, but you cannot change the order of priority for default policies. For example, suppose that for your Windows client devices, you have three next-generation protection policies. In this case, your default policy is number 3 in priority. You can change the order of your policies that are numbered 1 and 2, but the default policy will remain number 3 in your list. 

**The important thing to remember about multiple policies is that devices will receive the first applied policy only.** Referring to our earlier example of three next-generation policies, suppose that you have devices that are targeted by all three policies. In this case, those devices will receive policy number 1, but will not receive policies numbered 2 and 3.
