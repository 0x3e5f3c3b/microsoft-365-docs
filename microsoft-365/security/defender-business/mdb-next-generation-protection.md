# Review or edit your next-generation protection policies in Microsoft Defender for Business

In Defender for Business, next-generation protection includes robust antivirus and antimalware protection for computers and mobile devices. Default policies with recommended settings are included in Defender for Business. The default policies are designed to protect your devices and users without hindering productivity. However, you can customize your policies to suit your business needs. 

You can choose from several options for managing your next-generation protection policies:

- Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) (recommended if you're using the standalone version of Defender for Business without Intune); or 
- Use the Microsoft Intune admin center at [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com) (available if your subscription includes Intune)

## [**Microsoft 365 Defender portal**](#tab/M365D)

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system and policy type.

3. Select an operating system tab (such as **Windows clients**).

4. Expand **Next-generation protection** to view your list of policies.

5. Select a policy to view more details about the policy, and make any needed changes.

   To make changes or to learn more about policy settings, see the following articles: 
   
   - [View or edit device policies](mdb-view-edit-policies.md)
   - [Understand next-generation configuration settings](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md) 

## [**Intune admin center**](#tab/Intune)

1. Go to [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com) and sign in. You're now in the Intune admin center.<

2. Select **Endpoint security**.

3. Select **Antivirus** to view your policies in that category.

4. Select an individual policy to edit it. 

   For help with managing your security settings in Intune, start with [Manage endpoint security in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security).
