# Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!TIP]
> If your company is a small or midsized business (300 or fewer users) and you would like to sign up for the Microsoft Defender for Business preview program, visit [https://aka.ms/MDBPreview](https://aka.ms/MDBPreview).

Microsoft Defender for Business is designed with the busy small and midsized business in mind. For example, if you are already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can choose from automatic or manual onboarding. Or, if you're not already using Endpoint Manager, you can choose from several different onboarding packages and methods to use.

## Are you already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager?

If you are already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, your onboarding process can be streamlined. And if you are not already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you can choose from several options. The following table summarizes the various onboarding methods for Microsoft Defender for Business:

<br/><br/>

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** | Description and link |
| **Local script** | (for up to 10 devices). |
| **Group Policy** | description and link | 
| **Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) onboarding using a script** |  |
| **System Center Configuration Manager** | (for on-premises environments). |
| **Mobile Device Management** | (in Microsoft Intune) |

## Onboarding devices in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

If you are working through the initial setup and configuration process for Microsoft Defender for Business, you'll be prompted to onboard devices after you have [set up email notifications for your security team](mdb-email-notifications.md).

If you are not already using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you'll see a list of onboarding options.




## What if I want to offboard a device?

See [Offboard a device](mdb-manage-devices.md#offboard-a-device).

## Next step

After you have onboarded devices, your next step is to [Configure your security settings and policies in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-configure-security-settings.md).
