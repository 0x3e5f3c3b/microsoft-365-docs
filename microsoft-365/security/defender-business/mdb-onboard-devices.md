# Onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!TIP]
> If your company is a small or midsized business (300 or fewer users) and you would like to sign up for the Microsoft Defender for Business preview program, visit [https://aka.ms/MDBPreview](https://aka.ms/MDBPreview).

Microsoft Defender for Business is designed with the busy small and midsized business in mind. When it comes to onboarding devices, you can choose from several methods.

## Onboarding methods in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

If you're not already using MEM to onboard devices, you can choose from several methods in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)):

- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**. See [Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-mem.md).
- **Local script** (for up to 10 devices). See [Use a local script to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-local-script.md).
- **Group Policy**. See [Use Group Policy to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-group-policy.md). 
- **Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) onboarding using a script**. See [Use a script to onboard VDI endpoints to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-vdi-onboarding-script.md).
- **System Center Configuration Manager** (for on-premises environments). See [Use System Center Configuration Manager to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-sccm.md).
- **Mobile Device Management** (in Microsoft Intune). See [Use Mobile Device Management to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-onboarding-mdm.md).
