## Resources for Microsoft managed service providers

Most managed service providers (MSPs) offer a sophisticated stack of capabilities. For example, many MSPs offer software and services that include backup & recovery, network management, line of business apps, and cybersecurity capabilities. Small and medium-sized businesses recognize security as a key component to their success, but often don't have the capacity or expertise to have a dedicated security operations team. These customers often need help with managing the security of their endpoints and network, and addressing alerts or detected threats.

If you're a Microsoft MSP, Defender for Business (and Microsoft 365 Business Premium) can help you build your cybersecurity stack. You can integrate Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and your professional service automation (PSA) software. Such integration can be done by using the [Defender for Endpoint APIs](../defender-endpoint/management-apis.md).

## Use our APIs to integrate with your MSP solution

Using our Defender for Endpoint APIs for to integrate with your RMM tools and PSA software, you can:

- Get access to your customers' Microsoft 365 Defender portal to [address alerts and incidents](mdb-respond-mitigate-threats.md).
- Get [email notifications](mdb-email-notifications.md) about new alerts or vulnerabilities across your customers' tenants.
- Fetch and view [incidents and alerts](mdb-view-manage-incidents.md) with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Orchestrate [remediation actions](mdb-review-remediation-actions.md), such as approving actions following automated investigations, or taking manual response actions on a device.
