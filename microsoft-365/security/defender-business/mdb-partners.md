# Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft Partner Resources

Managed service providers (MSPs) often use a sophisticated stack of capabilities. For example, many MSPs offer software and services that include backup & recovery, network management, line of business apps, and cybersecurity capabilities. Defender for Business (and Microsoft 365 Business Premium) can help you build your cybersecurity stack. You can integrate Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium with your remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools and professional service automation (PSA). 

## Use APIs to integrate

Using our APIs for custom integration, you can:

- Get access to your customers' Microsoft 365 Defender portal​ to address alerts and incidents.
- Get email notifications​ about new alerts or vulnerabilities across your customers' tenants.
- Fetch and view incidents and alerts with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.​ 
- Orchestrate remediation actions, such as approving actions following automated investigations, or taking manual response actions on a device.
