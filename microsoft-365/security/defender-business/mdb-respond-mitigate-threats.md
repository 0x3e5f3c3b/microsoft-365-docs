# Respond to and mitigate threats in Microsoft Defender for business


When you sign into the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, on the Home page, youâ€™ll see cards that tell you at a glance how many threats were detected, along with how many user accounts, endpoints (devices), and other assets were affected.

Each card includes a button or a link you can use to view to more information and take action. For example, the **Devices at risk** card includes a **View details** button. When you select that button, you go to your **Device inventory**. On that page, your company's devices are listed, along with their risk level and exposure level.

When you select a device, the flyout pane opens and displays more information about alerts and incidents generated for that device.

On the flyout, you can view information and take one of several actions. Select the ellipsis (...) to open a menu that lists available actions.

On the flyout, select an action. For example, you might choose **Run antivirus scan**, which will cause Microsoft Defender Antivirus to start a quick scan on the device. Or, you could select **Initiate Automated Investigation** to trigger an automated investigation on the device.
