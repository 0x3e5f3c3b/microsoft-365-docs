# Respond to and mitigate threats in Microsoft Defender for Business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information in this article relates to prereleased products/services that might be substantially modified before they are commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, for the information provided here. This article includes links to online content that might describe some features that are not included in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview).

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal enables your security team to respond to and mitigate detected threats.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) and sign in.

2. Notice cards on the Home page. Cards tell you at a glance how many threats were detected, along with how many user accounts, endpoints (devices), and other assets were affected. The following image is an example of cards you might see:

3. Select a button or link on the card to view more information and take action. As an example, our **Devices at risk** card includes a **View details** button. Selecting that button takes us to the **Device inventory** page, as shown in the following image:

   The **Device inventory** page lists company devices, along with their risk level and exposure level.

4. Select an item, such as a device. A flyout pane opens and displays more information about alerts and incidents generated for that item, as shown in the following image:  

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-business/mdb-deviceinventory-selecteddeviceflyout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the flyout pane for a selected device":::

5. On the flyout, view the information that is displayed. Select the ellipsis (...) to open a menu that lists available actions, as shown in the following image: 

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-business/mdb-deviceinventory-selecteddeviceflyout-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of available actions for a selected device":::

6. Select an available action. For example, you might choose **Run antivirus scan**, which will cause Microsoft Defender Antivirus to start a quick scan on the device. Or, you could select **Initiate Automated Investigation** to trigger an automated investigation on the device.
