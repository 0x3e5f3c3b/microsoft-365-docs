# Review remediation actions in the Action center

As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play. Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval. Examples of remediation actions include sending a file to quarantine, stopping a process from running, and removing a scheduled task. All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.

## Visit the Action center

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)), and sign in.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**.

3. Select the **Pending** tab to view and approve (or reject) any pending actions. Such actions can arise from antivirus/antimalware protection, automated investigations, manual response activities, or live response sessions.

4. Select the **History** tab to view a list of completed actions.
