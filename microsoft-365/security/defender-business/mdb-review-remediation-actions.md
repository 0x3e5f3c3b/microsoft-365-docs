# Review remediation actions in the Action center

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information in this article relates to prereleased products/services that might be substantially modified before they are commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, for the information provided here. This article includes links to online content that might describe some features that are not included in Microsoft Defender for Business (preview).

As threats are detected, remediation actions come into play. Depending on the particular threat and how your security settings are configured, remediation actions might be taken automatically or only upon approval. Examples of remediation actions include sending a file to quarantine, stopping a process from running, and removing a scheduled task. All remediation actions are tracked in the Action center.
