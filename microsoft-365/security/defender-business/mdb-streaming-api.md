## Use the streaming API (preview) with Microsoft Defender for Business

If your organization has a Security Operations Center (SOC), the ability to use the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint streaming API is now in preview for [Defender for Business](mdb-overview.md) and [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](../../business-premium/index.md). The API enables you to stream data, such as device file, registry, network, sign-in events, and more to one of the following services:

- [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview) 
- [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)
- [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction)

With the streaming API, you can now use [advanced hunting](../defender/advanced-hunting-overview.md) and [attack detection](../defender-endpoint/overview-endpoint-detection-response.md) with Defender for Business and Microsoft 365 Business Premium. The streaming API enables SOCs to view more data about devices, understand better how an attack occurred, and take steps to improve device security. 

## Use the streaming API with Sentinel


## Use the streaming API with Event Hubs
