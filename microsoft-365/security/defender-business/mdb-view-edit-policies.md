## View your next-generation protection policies

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. You’re now in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. To view more details about a policy, select its name. A side pane will open that provides more information about that policy, such as which devices are protected by that policy.

## Edit an existing next-generation protection policy

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. You’re now in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Device configuration**. Policies are organized by operating system (such as **Windows client**) and policy type (such as **Next-generation protection** and **Firewall**). 

3. Select an operating system tab (for example, **Windows clients**), and then review the list of **Next-generation protection** policies. 

4. To edit a policy, select its name, and then choose **Edit**.

5. On the **General information** tab, review the information. If necessary, you can edit the description. Then choose **Next**.

6. On the **Device groups** tab, determine which device groups should receive this policy.  

   - To keep the selected device group as it is, choose **Next**.
   - To remove a device group from the policy, select **Remove**.
   - To set up a new device group, select **Create new group**, and then set up your device group. (To get help with this task, see [Add or remove devices from a group](mdb-manage-devices.md#add-or-remove-devices-from-a-group).)
   - To apply the policy to another device group, select **Use existing group**.

   After you have specified which device groups should receive the policy, choose **Next**.

7. On the **Configuration settings** tab, review the settings. If necessary, you can edit the settings for your policy. (To get help with this task, see [Understand next-generation configuration settings in Microsoft Defender for Business](mdb-next-gen-configuration-settings.md).)

   After you have specified your next-generation protection settings, choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review your policy** tab, review the general information, targeted devices, and configuration settings. 

   - Make any needed changes by selecting **Edit**.
   - When you’re ready to proceed, choose **Update policy**.
