# Trial playbook: Microsoft Defender for Business

Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Business trial playbook. This playbook is a simple guide to help you make the most of your 30-day free trial. Using the recommendations in this article from the Microsoft Defender team, you'll learn how Defender for Business can help you elevate your security from traditional antivirus to next-gen protection, endpoint detection and response, and threat and vulnerability management. 

## What is Microsoft Defender for Business? 

Microsoft Defender for Business is a new endpoint security solution that was designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). With this endpoint security solution, your organization's devices are better protected from ransomware, malware, phishing, and other threats.

## Step 1: Setting up your trial

Microsoft Defender for Business features a simplified configuration process designed especially for small and medium-sized businesses. This experience takes the guesswork out of onboarding and managing Windows devices, with a wizard-like experience and default policies that are designed to protect your organization's Windows devices from day one. We recommend using the simplified configuration process; however, you're not limited to this option.
