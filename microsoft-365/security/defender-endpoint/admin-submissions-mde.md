## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To submit files to Microsoft, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups:

  - **Organization Management** or **Security Reader** in theÂ [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](../office-365-security/permissions-microsoft-365-security-center.md).

- For more information about how you can submit spam, phish, URLs, files, and file hashes (SHAs) to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](../office-365-security/report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## Report suspicious content to Microsoft

If you have a file that you suspect might be malware or is being incorrectly detected, you can submit it to Microsoft for analysis using Microsoft 365 Defender at https://security.microsoft.com/.

### Submit a suspected file or file hash

1. Open the Microsoft 365 Defender at <https://security.microsoft.com/>, click **Submissions**, and then select **Add new submission**.
