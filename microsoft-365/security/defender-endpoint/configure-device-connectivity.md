# Onboarding devices using streamlined device connectivity for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint 

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)


[!Include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service requires the use of proxy configurations to report diagnostic data and communicate data to the service. 


In this article, you will learn about the streamlined device connectivity method and how to onboard new devices so that you can  leverage the straightforward deployment and management of Defender for Endpoint cloud connectivity services. For more information on migrating previously onboarded devices, see [Migrating devices to streamlined connectivity](migrate-devices-streamlined.md). 


To simplify the configuration of network requirements and ease management, you now have the option of onboarding devices to Defender for Endpoint using a reduced URL set or static IP ranges. 

The Defender for Endpoint-recognized simplified domain: **\*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com** replaces the following core Defender for Endpoint services: Cloud Protection/MAPS, Malware Sample Submission Storage, AutoIR Sample Storage,  Defender for Endpoint Command & Control, and EDR Cyberdata. 

Alternatively, to support network devices without hostname resolution or wildcard support, you can configure connectivity using dedicated Defender for Endpoint static IP ranges. For more information, see [Configure connectivity using static IP ranges](#option-2-configure-connectivity-using-static-ip-ranges).

>[!NOTE] 
>The simplified connectivity method will **not change how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint functions on a device nor will it change the end-user experience**. Only the URLs or IPs that a device uses to connect to the service will change. 

Prior to the availability of the simplified method of device connectivity, specific URLs had to be added to the allowed domains list. Defender for Endpoint static IP ranges were not supported. For more information, see [Configure your environment to connect to the Defender for Endpoint service](configure-environment.md#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server). 

## Consolidated services 


As part of this preview, this section lists the Defender for Endpoint services that have been consolidated under the new simplified domain. Previously, you may have been using these endpoints. 

The table below lists the Defender for Endpoint service URLs that are consolidated under the new simplified domain: **\*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com**.

For the full list of required URLs, see [LINK TO UPDATED URL LIST]().

>[!NOTE] 
>You will need to onboard devices using the modified onboarding script to leverage this reduced URL set.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The following Defender for Endpoint URLs consolidated under the simplified domain should no longer be required for connectivity if **\*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com** is allowed and devices are onboarded using the updated onboarding script. <br>
>You will need to maintain connectivity with other required services not consolidated that are relevant to your organization (for example, CRL, SmartScreen/Network Protection, and WNS). For more information on the detailed list of URLs, [Download the spreadsheet here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/b/f/6bfff670-47c3-4e45-b01b-64a2610eaefa/mde-urls-commercial.xlsx).

>[!NOTE]
>Applies to Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Stage 1. Configure your environment for cloud connectivity 

Because some URLs and IPs have been consolidated into the new domain, you'll need to configure your existing network device settings to connect using the new method instead.  For more information, see [Configure your network environment to ensure connectivity with Defender for Endpoint service](configure-environment.md). 

Defender for Endpoint services consolidated under the simplified method should no longer be required for connectivity. However, some URLs are not included in the consolidation. For more information on the list of services not included in the consolidation, see [Services not included in the consolidated domain](#services-not-included-in-the-consolidated-domain).

The following list provides options you can use to configure your environment for cloud connectivity:

- [Option 1: Use the simplified domain](#option-1-configure-connectivity-using-the-simplified-domain)
- [Option 2: Use static IP ranges](#option-2-configure-connectivity-using-static-ip-ranges)
 




### Option 1: Configure connectivity using the simplified domain

Configure your environment to allow connections with the simplified Defender for Endpoint domain: **\*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com**. For more information, see [Configure your network environment to ensure connectivity with Defender for Endpoint service](configure-environment.md).

Ensure you have connectivity with other required Defender for Endpoint [services not consolidated](#services-not-included-in-the-consolidated-domain) under simplified method. 

### Option 2: Configure connectivity using static IP ranges 

Alternatively, if you're using the IP range method, allow firewall or proxy connections to **all of the following Defender for Endpoint** **IP** **addresses**. These ranges cover the following Defender for Endpoint services: MAPS, Malware Sample Submission Storage, AutoIR Sample Storage, Defender for Endpoint Command and Control.



| <u>**Location** </u>  | <u>**IP Range Prefix** </u>  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| <u>Central US </u>    | <u>20.15.141.0/24 </u>       |
| <u>East US </u>       | <u>20.242.181.0/24 </u>      |
| <u>East US 2 </u>     | <u>20.10.127.0/24 </u>       |
| <u>West US </u>       | <u>13.83.125.0/24 </u>       |
| <u>North Europe </u>  | <u>4.208.13.0/24 </u>        |
| <u>West Europe </u>   | <u>20.8.195.0/24 </u>        |
| <u>UK South </u>      | <u>20.26.63.224/28 </u>      |
| <u>UK West </u>       | <u>20.254.173.48/28 </u>     |

>[!WARNING]
>**The Defender for Endpoint static IP ranges do not include EDR Cyberdata.** This service has static IPs available under the 'OneDSCollector' Azure service tag. For more information, see [Home Page - Azure IP Ranges](https://azureipranges.azurewebsites.net/). Traffic for these IPs is not limited to EDR cyber data - its shared across Microsoft applications such as Office, Intune, Teams, and others.


As with the URL method, ensure you maintain connectivity with other required [services not consolidated](#services-not-included-in-the-consolidated-domain).  The following static IPs only cover the following services: MAPS, Malware Sample Submission Storage, AutoIR Sample Storage, Defender for Endpoint Command and Control.


>[!IMPORTANT]
> In compliance with Defender for Endpoint security and compliance standards, your data will be processed and stored in accordance with your tenant's physical location. Based on client location, traffic may flow through any of these IP regions (which correspond to Azure datacenter regions). For more information, see [Data storage and privacy](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/data-storage-privacy).  

## Stage 2. Onboard devices using the simplified method

>[!NOTE]
>For tenants created before *this date*, this will show as the default method. Once you have configured your network environment to communicate with the full list of required URLs you can begin onboarding or migrating devices.  

Confirm devices meet [prerequisites](#operating-systems-prerequisites) and have fully updated Microsoft Defender Antivirus versions.

Configure devices to communicate through connectivity infrastructure. For more information, see [Configure device proxy and Internet connection settings ](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-proxy-internet).


### Use Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer to validate connectivity with new URLs pre-onboarding 

Run Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer on devices to confirm pre-onboarding connectivity with new endpoints: 

1.  Download and extract [Client analyzer](https://aka.ms/BetaMDEAnalyzer).

2.  Download the 'simplified' onboarding package for relevant OS by navigating to ***Settings \> Endpoints \> Device management\> Onboarding*** in Microsoft 365 Defender portal.  

    1.  Extract the .cmd from onboarding package. 

3.  Open a command prompt as an administrator. 

4.  Run **mdeclientanalyzer.cmd -o \<path to cmd file\>** from within MDEClientAnalyzer folder. The command will use parameters from onboarding script to test connectivity.

5.  View connectivity results within HTML output file or command prompt.



### Onboard devices using the streamlined method

To leverage the new simplified onboarding method, you will need to onboard devices using the updated onboarding script. The onboarding script is required to establish communication with the updated URL/static IP ranges. 

1. Navigate to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal settings page.

2. Select **Settings > Endpoints > Device management> Onboarding**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/simplified-connectivity-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of onboarding page with simplified connectivity options":::

3. Navigate to the 'Simplified Connectivity options' toggle at the top of the page. Toggle to display the streamlined onboarding approach. 


    >[!NOTE]
    >If your tenant was created after *INSERT DATE HERE* , you will see the simplified option as the default setting.


4. Select the relevant OS from the operating system dropdown. 
 
5. Onboard using the deployment method of choice. See the preceeding section for guidelines on each deployment method.

    :::image type="content" source="images/connectivity-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of onboarding page with operating system options":::


Restarting devices is mandatory for devices that are currently onboarded to Defender for Endpoint. The switch will not be made until this occurs.   

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Restarting scenario: Restarting devices is required if devices have been previously onboarded to Defender for Endpoint. If you are migrating devices, you are not required to offboard. You can simply rerun the script and restart. 

For more information on what tools are supported and how to use them see the next section. 

### Migrating devices using the streamlined method

The following table lists the available tools based on the endpoint that you need to onboard.

Migration recommendation:

- **Start small** - It is recommended to start with a small set of devices first, apply to onboarding blob using any of the supported deployment tools, then monitor for connectivity. 

- **Validate and monitor** - After onboarding the small set of devices, validate that devices have successfully onboarded and are communicating with the service. 

- **Complete migration** - At this stage, you can gradually roll out the migration to a larger set of devices and remove the old URLs from your network device to complete the migration.

### Registry editor - MARYSIA TO CHECK WITH PAUL/ERAN IF KEEP SECTION
Check "OnboardedInfo" field in the Registry Editor (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection). 


>[!NOTE]
>The field may show as updated in Registry Editor even if the device is not connecting (reboot is still necessary for previously onboarded devices for full connectivity switch).


### PowerShell detection test 

1. On the Windows device, create a folder: `C:\test-MDATP-test`.

2. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.

3. In the Command Prompt window, run the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden $ErrorActionPreference = 'silentlycontinue';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://127.0.0.1/1.exe', 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe');Start-Process 'C:\\test-MDATP-test\\invoice.exe'
   ```

After the command runs, the Command Prompt window closes automatically. If successful, the detection test is marked as completed, and a new alert appears in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) for the newly onboarded device within about 10 minutes.



## Offboarding steps 

Use the following steps to offboard a device: 

1.  Run the 'simplified' offboarding script for the applicable OS found under the Endpoint settings offboarding page.  

2.  Restart the device.
