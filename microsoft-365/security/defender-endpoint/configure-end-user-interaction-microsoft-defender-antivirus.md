# Configure end-user interaction with Microsoft Defender Antivirus


**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)

You can configure how users of the endpoints on your network can interact with Microsoft Defender Antivirus. You can configure whether users see the Microsoft Defender Antivirus interface, what notifications they see, and if they can locally override globally deployed Group Policy settings.

Use the following articles to configure end-user interaction with Microsoft Defender Antivirus

- **[Configure notifications that appear on endpoints](configure-notifications-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md)** Configure and customize notifications, including text for notifications, and notifications about reboots that are needed for remediation.

- **[Prevent users from seeing or interacting with the Microsoft Defender Antivirus user interface](prevent-end-user-interaction-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md)** Hide the **Virus & threat protection** user interface from end users.

- **[Prevent users from locally modifying policy settings](configure-local-policy-overrides-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md)** Prevent (or allow) users from overriding policy settings on their individual endpoints.
