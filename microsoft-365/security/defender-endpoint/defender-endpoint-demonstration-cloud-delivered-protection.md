# Cloud-delivered protection demonstration

Cloud-delivered protection for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, also referred to as Microsoft Advanced Protection Service (MAPS), provides you with strong, fast protection in addition to our standard real-time protection.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows 7, Windows 8.1 & Windows 10
- Microsoft Defender Real-time protection is enabled
- Cloud-delivered protection is enabled by default, however you may need to re-enable it if it has been disabled as part of previous organizational policies. See the [Enable cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender AV](/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus?ocid=wd-av-demo-cloud-middle) topic for more information.
- You can also download and use the @@@[PowerShell script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsDefender_InternalEvaluationSettings/) to enable this setting and others on Windows 10.

### Scenario

1. [Click here](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint-df.com/:u:/p/alexkautz/ESSB16ruEZRIpA04A2_PpLwBBEjTh6dkC0knUCtg470Vqg) to download the test file. Important: The test file is not malicious, it is just a harmless file simulating a virus

2. If you see file blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, click on "View downloads" button.

   :::image type="content" source="images/cloud-delivered-protection-smartscreen-block.png" alt-text="SmartScreen blocks an unsafe download, and provides a button to click to view the **Downloads** list details.":::

3. In Downloads menu right click on the blocked file and click on **Download unsafe file**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/cloud-delivered-protection-smartscreen-block-view-downloads.png" alt-text="Lists the download as unsafe, but provides an option to proceed with the download":::

4. If successful you should see that "Microsoft Defender Antivirus" found a virus and deleted it.

   :::image type="content" source="images/cloud-delivered-protection-smartscreen-blocked-successful.png" alt-text="Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects the virus and deletes the unsafe download.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > In some cases, you might also see **Threat Found** notification from Microsoft Defender Security Center.

   :::image type="content" source="images/cloud-delivered-protection-smartscreen-threat-found-notification.png" alt-text="Microsoft Defender Antivirus Threats found notification provides options to get details":::

5. If the file executes, or if you see it blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen it means that cloud-delivered protection is not working and you should go to [Configure and validate network connections for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-network-connections-windows-defender-antivirus?ocid=wd-av-demo-cloud-middle) to learn more.

### Example

Failed to block (but stopped by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen)
