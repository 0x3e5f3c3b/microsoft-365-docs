## Mixed licensing scenarios

Suppose that your organization is using a mix of Microsoft endpoint security subscriptions, such as Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Defender for Endpoint Plan 2. **Currently, the highest functional Microsoft endpoint security subscription sets the experience for your tenant**. In this example, your tenant experience would be Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 for all users.

However, **you can contact support and request an override for your tenant experience**. That is, you could request an override to keep the Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 experience for all users.
