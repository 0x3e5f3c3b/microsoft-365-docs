# Trial playbook: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint trial playbook!

This playbook is a simple guide to help you make the most of your 90-day free trial. Using the suggested steps in this article from the Microsoft Defender team, you'll learn how Defender for Endpoint can help you to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

## What is Defender for Endpoint?

Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform that uses the following combination of technology built into Windows and Microsoft's robust cloud service: 

- **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Defender for Endpoint.

- **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, device learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.

- **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data.
