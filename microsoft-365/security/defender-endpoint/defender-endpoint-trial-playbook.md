# Trial playbook: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Welcome to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint trial playbook!

This playbook is a simple guide to help you make the most of your 90-day free trial. Using the suggested steps in this article from the Microsoft Defender team, you'll learn how Defender for Endpoint can help you to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

## What is Defender for Endpoint?

Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform that uses the following combination of technology built into Windows and Microsoft's robust cloud service: 

- **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Defender for Endpoint.

- **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, device learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.

- **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data.

Let's get started!

## Set up your trial

Here's how to set up your trial subscription:

1. [Confirm your license state](#step-1-confirm-your-license-state).
2. 

## Step 1: Confirm your license state

To make sure your Defender for Endpoint subscription is properly provisioned, you can check your license state in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Microsoft Azure portal.

[Check your license state](production-deployment.md#check-license-state).

## Step 2: Set up role-based access control and grant permissions to your security team

Microsoft recommends using the concept of least privileges. Defender for Endpoint leverages built-in roles within Azure Active Directory. [Review the different roles that are available](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) and choose the right one to solve your needs for each persona for this application. Some roles may need to be applied temporarily and removed after the trial has been completed.

Use [Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) to manage your roles to provide additional auditing, control, and access review for users with directory permissions.
Defender for Endpoint supports two ways to manage permissions:

- Basic permissions management: Set permissions to either full access or read-only. Users with Global Administrator or Security Administrator roles in Azure Active Directory have full access. The Security reader role has read-only access and does not grant access to view machines/device inventory.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): Set granular permissions by defining roles, assigning Azure AD user groups to the roles, and granting the user groups access to device groups. For more information, see [Manage portal access using role-based access control](rbac.md).

## Step 3: Visit the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is where you can access your Defender for Endpoint capabilities.

1. [Review what to expect](../defender/microsoft-365-defender.md) in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

2. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in.

3. In the navigation pane, see the **Endpoints** section to access your capabilities. 

## Step 4: Onboard endpoints using any of the supported management tools 

This section outlines the general steps you need to take to onboard devices (endpoints).

1. [Watch this video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4bGqr) for a quick overview of the onboarding process and learn about the available tools and methods.

2. Review which onboarding tool options are most appropriate to your environment to source instructions on how to onboard. 

## Step 5: Configure capabilities 

After onboarding the endpoints, you'll then configure the various capabilities such as endpoint detection and response, next-generation protection, and attack surface reduction.
•	Use this table for the components that you can configure. Choose the components that you'd like to use and remove the ones that do not apply.

## Step 6: Experience Microsoft Defender for Endpoint through simulated attacks

You might want to experience Defender for Endpoint before you onboard more than a few devices to the service. To do this, you can run controlled attack simulations on a few test devices. After running the simulated attacks, you can review how Defender for Endpoint surfaces malicious activity and explore how it enables an efficient response.
To run any of the provided simulations, you need at least one onboarded device.
1.	Read the walkthrough document provided with each attack scenario. Each document includes OS and application requirements as well as detailed instructions that are specific to an attack scenario.
2.	Run a simulation

## Step 7: Set up the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint evaluation lab   

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint evaluation lab is designed to eliminate the complexities of device and environment configuration so that you can focus on evaluating the capabilities of the platform, running simulations, and seeing the prevention, detection, and remediation features in action. Using the simplified set-up experience in evaluation lab, you can focus on running your own test scenarios and the pre-made simulations to see how Defender for Endpoint performs.
•	Watch the video overview    of evaluation lab
•	Get started with the lab
