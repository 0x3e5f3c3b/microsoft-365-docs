# Device control in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Device control capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enable your security team to control whether users can install and use peripheral devices, like removable storage (USB thumb drives, CDs, disks, etc.), printers, Bluetooth or other devices with their computers. Your security team can configure device control policies to configure rules like these:

- Prevent users from installing and using certain devices (like USB drives)
- Prevent users from installing and using any external devices with specific exceptions
- Allow users to install and use specific devices
- Allow users to install and use only BitLocker-encrypted devices with Windows computers

This list is intended to provide some examples. It’s not an exhaustive list; there are other examples to consider (see the use cases section in this article). 

Device control helps protect your organization from potential data loss, malware, or other cyberthreats by allowing or preventing certain devices to be connected to users’ computers. With device control, your security team can determine whether and what peripheral devices users can install and use on their computers.
