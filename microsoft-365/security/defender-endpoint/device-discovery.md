# Device discovery overview

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- - [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Protecting your environment requires taking inventory of the devices that are in your network. However, mapping devices in a network can often be expensive, challenging, and time-consuming.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides a device discovery capability that helps you find unmanaged devices connected to your corporate network without the need for extra appliances or cumbersome process changes. Device discovery uses onboarded endpoints, in your network to collect, probe, or scan your network to discover unmanaged devices. The device discovery capability allows you to discover:

- laptops, workstations and servers not yet onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Network devices like routers
- IoT devices like printers and cameras

Whether it's an unpatched printer, a network devices with weak security configuration, or a server with no security controls, Unknown and unmanaged devices, introduce significant risks to your network. Once devices are discovered, you can:

- Onboard unmanaged endpoints to the service, increasing the security visibility on them.
- Reduce the attack surface by identifying and assessing vulnerabilities, and detecting configuration gaps.

Watch this video for a quick overview of how device discovery:

In conjunction with this capability, a new security recommendation to onboard devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will be available as part of the existing Threat and Vulnerability Management experience.

## Discovery methods

There are two modes of discovery:

- Basic discovery
- Standard discovery (recommended)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Discovery is set to basic mode. You can choose to retain this configuration through the settings page. Standard discovery will be the default mode for all customers starting July 19, 2021 - unless modified through the settings page before this date.


Only devices that were observed by the basic discovery mode will be actively probed in standard mode.


### Basic discovery

In this mode, endpoints will passively collect events in your network and extract device information from them. Basic discovery uses the SenseNDR.exe binary for passive network data collection and no network traffic will be initiated. Endpoints will simply extract data from every network traffic that is seen by an onboarded device.

### Standard discovery

This mode allows endpoints to actively probe observed devices in the network to enrich collected data and discover more devices - helping you build a reliable and coherent device inventory. Standard mode uses smart, active probing to discover even more information about observed devices to enrich existing device information. Standard mode also leverages common discovery protocols that use multicast queries in the network to find even more devices, in addition to the ones that were observed using the passive method.

When Standard mode is enabled, minimal and negligible network activity generated by the discovery sensor might be observed by network monitoring tools in your organization.

 If you choose not to enable this mode, you will only gain limited visibility of unmanaged endpoints in your network.

Standard discovery uses various PowerShell scripts to actively probe devices in the network. Those PowerShell scripts are Microsoft signed and are executed from the following location: `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\Downloads\*.ps`. For example, `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\Downloads\UnicastScannerV1.1.0.ps1`.

You can change and customize your discovery settings, for more information see [Configure device discovery](configure-device-discovery.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The discovery engine distinguishes between network events that are received in the corporate network versus outside of the corporate network. Devices that are not connected to corporate networks will not be discovered or listed in the device inventory.

## Network device discovery

_A designated Microsoft Defender for Endpoint device will be used on each network segment to perform periodic authenticated scans of preconfigured network devices. Once discovered, Defender for Endpoint's threat and vulnerability management capabilities provide integrated workflows to secure discovered switches, routers, WLAN controllers, firewalls, and VPN gateways._

## Device discovery integration

To extend your device discovery capabilities to include areas of the network the following integrations are available:

Microsoft Defender for IoT is a unified security solution for identifying IoT/OT devices, vulnerabilities, and threats. It enables you to secure your entire IoT/OT environment, whether you need to protect existing IoT/OT devices or build security into new IoT innovations. Integration with Microsoft Defender for IoT extends Microsoft Defender for Endpoint device discovery capabilities. 
Microsoft Defender for IoT is a unified security solution for identifying IoT/OT devices, vulnerabilities, and threats.

View your complete IT/IoT inventory along side the rest of your IT devices (workstations, servers and mobile) within a single unified view.
For more information:

Microsoft have partnered with Corelight to enable sending of events from the Corelight network appliances to Microsoft 365 Defender.
This will allow Microsoft 365 Defender to extend its security value with visibility to network activities of unmanaged devices in cases they communicate with other unmanaged devices or external networks.

## Device Inventory

Devices that have been discovered but have not yet been onboarded and secured by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will be listed in Device Inventory within the Endpoints tab.
You can now use a new filter in the device inventory list called Onboarding status which can have any of the following values:

- Onboarded: The endpoint is onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Can be onboarded: The endpoint was discovered in the network and the Operating System was identified as one that is supported by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, but it is not currently onboarded. We highly recommend onboarding these devices.
- Unsupported: The endpoint was discovered in the network but is not supported by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Insufficient info: The system could not determine the supportability of the device. Enabling standard discovery on more devices in the network can enrich the discovered attributes.

> [!TIP]
> You can always apply filters to exclude unmanaged devices from the device inventory list. You can also use the onboarding status column on API queries to filter out unmanaged devices.

## Vulnerability assessment on discovered devices

Vulnerabilities and risks on your devices as well as other discovered unmanaged devices in the network are part of the current TVM flows under "Security Recommendations" and represented in entity pages across the portal.
Search for "SSH" related security recommendations to find SSH vulnerabilities that are related for unmanaged and managed devices.

## Use Advanced Hunting on discovered devices

You can use Advanced Hunting queries to gain visibility on discovered devices.
Find details about discovered Endpoints in the DeviceInfo table, or network-related information about those devices in the DeviceNetworkInfo table.

Device discovery leverages Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarded devices as a network data source to attribute activities to non-onboarded devices. This means that if a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarded device communicated with a non-onboarded device, activities on the non-onboarded device can be seen on the timeline and through the Advanced hunting DeviceNetworkEvents table.

New events are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections-based and will fit to the current DeviceNetworkEvents scheme. TCP ingress to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enabled device from a non-Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enabled.

The following action types have also been added:

- ConnectionAttempt - An attempt to establish a TCP connection (syn)
- ConnectionAcknowledged - An acknowledgment that a TCP connection was accepted (syn\ack)

You can try this example query:

```text
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionAcknowledged" or ActionType == "ConnectionAttempt"
| take 10
```

## Changed behavior

The following section lists the changes you'll observe in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2077139" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Defender portal</a> when this capability is enabled.

1. Devices that are not onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint are expected to appear in the device inventory, advanced hunting, and API queries. This may significantly increase the size of query results.
    1. "DeviceInfo" and "DeviceNetworkInfo" tables in Advanced Hunting will now hold discovered device. You can filter out those devices by using "OnboardingStatus" attribute.
    2. Discovered devices are expected to appear in Streaming API query results. You can filter out those devices by using the `OnboardingStatus` filter in your query.
2. Unmanaged devices will be assigned to existing device groups based on the defined criteria.
3. In rare cases, Standard discovery might trigger alerts on network monitors or security tools. Please provide feedback, if you experience such events, to help prevent these issues from recurring. You can explicitly exclude specific targets or entire subnets from being actively probed by Standard discovery.
