## How to Allow Full Disk Access

The macOS Catalina (10.15) requires full disk access to be granted to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** in order to be able to protect and monitor.

> [!Note]
> Full disk access grant to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** is a new requirement for all the third-party software by Apple for files and folders containing personal data.

To grant full disk access:

1. Open **System Preferences** \> **Security & Privacy** \> **Privacy** \> **Full Disk Access**. Click the lock icon to make changes (bottom of the dialog box).
1. Grant **Full Disk Access** permission to **Microsoft Defender** and **Microsoft Defenders Endpoint Security Extension**.

1. Select **General** \> **Restart** for the new system extentions to take effect.

   :::image type="content" source="images/restart-fulldisk.png" alt-text="Screenshot that allows you to restart the system for new system extentions to be enabled.":::
1. Enable *Potentially Unwanted Application* (PUA) in block mode.

   To enable PUA, refer [configure PUA protection](mac-pua.md).
1. Enable *Network Protection*.

   To enbale *Network protection*, refer [manual deployment](network-protection-macos.md).
1. Enable *Device Control*.

   To enable *Device Control*, refer [device control for macOS](mac-device-control-overview.md).
1. Enable *Tamper Protection* in block mode.

   To enable *Tamper Protection*, refer [Protect MacOS security settings with tamper protection](tamperprotection-macos.md).
1. If you have the *Microsoft Purview â€“ Endpoint data loss prevention license*,  you can review [Get started with Microsoft Purview - Endpoint data loss prevention](/purview/endpoint-dlp-getting-started).

## Onboarding Package

Once you have installed the MDE on macOS client, you must now onboard the package, which registers to your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant and licenses it.

1. Verify if MDE on macOS has already been onboarded.

   Copy *wdav.pkg* and *MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh* to the device where you have deployed Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS.

    The client device isn't associated with *org_id*. The *org_id* attribute is blank.

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

2. Run the Bash script to install the onboarding package:

    ```bash
    Sudo bash -x MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingMacOs.sh
    ```

3. Verify that the device is now associated with your organization and reports a valid org ID:

    ```bash
    mdatp health --field org_id
    ```

    After installation, you'll see the Microsoft Defender icon in the macOS status bar in the top-right corner.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="images/mdatp-icon-bar.png" alt-text="The Microsoft Defender icon in status bar" lightbox="images/mdatp-icon-bar.png":::

   You can [troubleshoot license issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](mac-support-license.md).

4. Run the connectivity test.

   ```bash
   mdatp connectivity test
   ```

   You can [troubleshoot cloud connectivity issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](troubleshoot-cloud-connect-mdemac.md).

## AV detection test for verifying device's onboarding and reporting services

   Run an AV detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

1. Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of 1 from running the following command):

```bash
mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
```

2. Open a Terminal window. Copy and execute the following command:

```bash
curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt
```

3. The file has been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Mac. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

```bash
mdatp threat list
```

## EDR detection test for verifying device's onboarding and reporting services

Run an EDR detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

1. In your browser, Microsoft Edge for Mac or Safari, download *MDATP MacOS DIY.zip* from [https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy](https://aka.ms/mdatpmacosdiy)and extract.

      The following prompt appears:

      > Do you want to allow downloads on "mdatpclientanalyzer.blob.core.windows.net"?<br/>
      > You can change which websites can download files in **Websites Preferences**.

4. Click **Allow**.

5. Open **Downloads**.

6. You must be able to see **MDATP MacOS DIY**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you double-click **MDATP MacOS DIY**, you will get the following message:
   >
   > > **"MDATP MacOS DIY" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verifier.**<br/>
   > > macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.<br/>
   > > **\[Move to Trash\]** **\[Cancel\]**

7. Click **Cancel**.

8. Right-click **MDATP MacOS DIY**, and then click **Open**.

    The system displays the following message:

    > **macOS cannot verify the developer of MDATP MacOS DIY. Are you sure you want to open it?**<br/>
    > By opening this app, you will be overriding system security which can expose your computer and personal information to malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

9. Click **Open**.

    The system will display the following message:

    > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - macOS EDR DIY test file<br/>
    > Corresponding alert will be available in the MDATP portal.

10. Click **Open**.

    In few minutes, an alert *macOS EDR Test Alert* is raised.

11. Go to Microsoft Defender portal (https://security.microsoft.com/).

12. Go to the **Alert** Queue.

    :::image type="content" source="images/b8db76c2-c368-49ad-970f-dcb87534d9be.png" alt-text="An macOS EDR test alert that shows severity, category, detection source, and a collapsed menu of actions" lightbox="images/b8db76c2-c368-49ad-970f-dcb87534d9be.png":::

    The macOS EDR test alert that shows severity, category, detection source, and a collapsed menu of actions.

    Look at the alert details and the device timeline, and perform the regular investigation steps.

 Next steps that you can consider performing are to add AV exclusions as needed for application compatibility or performance:
