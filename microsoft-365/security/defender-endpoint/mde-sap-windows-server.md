# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server with SAP

> [!NOTE]
> As a Principal Software Architect, Cameron Gardiner contributed to and provided material feedback for this article.

If your organization uses SAP, it's essential to understand the compatibility and support between Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server with EDR and SAP applications. This article helps you understand the support provided by SAP for endpoint protection security solutions like Defender for Endpoint with EDR and how it interacts with SAP applications.

This documentation applies to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint running on Windows Server OS Releases with SAP applications such, as NetWeaver, S4 Hana, and SAP standalone engines, such as LiveCache. This documentation doesn't cover SAP client software, such as SAPGUI or Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows client devices.

## Enterprise security and your SAP Basis team

Enterprise Security is a specialist role and the activities described below should be planned as a joint activity between the Enterprise Security Team and the SAP Basis Team. The Enterprise Security Team needs to coordinate with the SAP Basis Team and jointly design the Defender for Endpoint configuration and analyze any exclusions. 

### Get an overview of Defender for Endpoint

Defender for Endpoint is a component of [Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/), and can be integrated with your SIEM/SOAR solution. 

Before you begin to plan or deploy Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server with SAP, take a moment to get an overview. Watch the following video to learn more about Defender for Endpoint:

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4wDob]

For more detailed information about Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft security offerings, see the following resources:

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Security documentation and training - Security documentation](/security/)

The Microsoft Defender XDR solution incorporates many security components that are beyond the scope of this article. In this article, we focus on two main areas of Defender for Endpoint:

- **Next-generation protection** (which includes antivirus protection). [Next-generation protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-generation-protection) is an antivirus product like other antivirus solutions for Windows environments.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response** (EDR). [EDR capabilities](overview-endpoint-detection-response.md) detect suspicious activity and system calls, and provide an extra layer of protection against threats that bypassed antivirus protection. 

Microsoft and other security software vendors track threats and provide trend information. For information, see [Cyberthreats, viruses, and malware - Microsoft Security Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats). 

> [!NOTE]
> For information on Microsoft Defender for SAP on Linux, see [Deployment guidance for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux for SAP](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mde-linux-deployment-on-sap). Defender for Endpoint on Linux is significantly different than the Windows version. 

## SAP support statement on Defender for Endpoint and other Microsoft security solutions

SAP provides basic documentation for conventional file scan antivirus solutions. Conventional file scan antivirus solutions compare file signatures against a database of known threats. When an infected file is identified, the antivirus software typically alerts and quarantines the file. The mechanisms and behavior of file scan antivirus solutions are reasonably well known and are predictable; therefore, SAP support can provide a basic level of support for SAP applications interacting with file scan antivirus software. 

File based threats are now only one possible vector for malicious software. Fileless malware and that lives off the land, highly polymorphic threats that mutate faster than traditional solutions can keep up with, and human-operated attacks that adapt to what adversaries find on compromised devices. Traditional antivirus security solutions aren't sufficient to stop such attacks. Artificial intelligence (AI) and device learning (ML) backed capabilities, such as behavioral blocking and containment are required. Security software such as Defender for Endpoint EDR has advanced threat protection (ATP) features to mitigate modern threats. 

Defender for Endpoint is continuously monitoring Operating System calls such as file read, file write, create socket, and other process level operations. The Defender for Endpoint EDR sensor acquires Opportunistic Locks on local NTFS files systems and is, therefore, unlikely to impact applications. Opportunistic locks aren't possible on remote network file systems, and in rare cases, a lock could cause general nonspecific errors in SAP applications such as *Access Denied*.

SAP isn't able to provide any level of support for EDR/XDR software as the mechanisms are adaptive; therefore, the mechanisms aren't predictable and potentially aren't reproducible. When problems are identified on systems running advanced security solutions, SAP recommends disabling the security software and trying to reproduce the problem. A support case can then be raised with the security software vendor. 

SAP Support policy is documented in [3356389 - Antivirus or other security software affecting SAP operations](https://me.sap.com/notes/3356389).

## SAP applications on Windows: Top 10 recommendations

1. **Limit access to SAP servers, block network ports, and take all other common security protection measures**. This is an essential first step. The threat landscape has evolved from "file based" Viruses to file-less complex and sophisticated threats. Steps such as **blocking ports and limiting logon/access** to VMs is **no longer considered sufficient** to fully mitigate modern threats.

2. **Deploy Defender for Endpoint to nonproductive systems first before deploying to production systems**. Deploying Defender for Endpoint directly to production systems without testing is highly risky and can lead to downtime. If you can't delay deploying Defender for Endpoint to your production systems, consider temporarily disabling [tamper protection](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md) and [real-time protection](configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md). 

3. **Real-time protection is enabled by default in Windows Server**. If problems are identified that might be related to Defender for Endpoint, it's recommended to [configure exclusions](defender-endpoint-antivirus-exclusions.md) and/or [open a support case](contact-support.md) via the Microsoft Defender portal. 

4. **Defender for Endpoint deployment should be a joint project between the SAP Basis Team and your organization's security team**. The two teams need to create a phased deployment, testing and monitoring plan.

5. **Use tools such as PerfMon (Windows) to create a performance baseline before deploying and activating Defender for Endpoint**. Compare the performance utilization before and after activating Defender for Endpoint. See [perfmon](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/perfmon).

6. **Deploy the latest version of Defender for Endpoint and use the latest releases of Windows**, ideally Windows Server 2019 or newer. See [Minimum requirements for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](minimum-requirements.md). 

7. **Configure certain exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus**. These include: 

   - DBMS data files, log files and temp files, including disks containing backup files
   - The entire contents of the SAPMNT directory
   - The entire contents of the SAPLOC directory
   - The entire contents of the TRANS directory
   - The entire contents of directories for standalone engines such as TREX

   For more information about DBMS exclusions, use the following resources:

      - **SQL Server**: [Configure antivirus software to work with SQL Server](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/security/antivirus-and-sql-server)
      - **Oracle**: [How To Configure Anti-Virus On Oracle Database Server (Doc ID 782354.1)](https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Database%20Products/782354_1.html)
      - **DB2** â€“ [Which DB2 directories to exclude from Linux Anti-virus software](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/which-db2-directories-exclude-linux-anti-virus-software) (use the same commands on Windows Server) 
      - **SAP ASE**: Contact SAP 
      - **MaxDB**: Contact SAP

8. **Verify Defender for Endpoint settings**. Microsoft Defender Antivirus with SAP applications should have the following settings in most cases: 

   - `AntivirusEnabled                   : True`
   - `AntivirusSignatureAge              : 0`
   - `BehaviorMonitorEnabled             : True`
   - `DefenderSignaturesOutOfDate        : False`
   - `IsTamperProtected                  : True`
   - `RealTimeProtectionEnabled          : True`

9. **Tools, such as [Intune](/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security) or [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](/mem/intune/protect/mde-security-integration) are recommended to ensure that Defender for Endpoint is configured correctly and uniformly deployed**. In the Microsoft Defender portal, go to **Endpoints** > **Configuration management** > **Endpoint security policies**, and then select **Create new Policy**. For more information, see [Manage endpoint security policies in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-security-policies). 

10. **Use the latest Defender for Endpoint for Windows release**. Several new features are being implemented in Defender for Endpoint on Windows, and these features were tested with SAP systems. These new features reduce blocking and lower CPU consumption. See [Microsoft Defender Antivirus security intelligence and product updates](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates).

## Deployment methodology

SAP and Microsoft don't recommend deploying Defender for Endpoint on Windows directly to all development, QAS, and production systems simultaneously, and/or without careful testing and monitoring. Customers who deployed Defender for Endpoint and other similar software in an uncontrolled manner without adequate testing have experienced system downtime as a result. 

Defender for Endpoint on Windows and any other software or configuration change should be deployed into development systems first, validated in QAS and only then deployed into production environments. 

Using tools, such as [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](/mem/intune/protect/mde-security-integration) to deploy Defender for Endpoint to an entire SAP landscape without testing is very likely to cause downtime.

Here's a list of what to test:

1. Deploy Defender for Endpoint  with [tamper protection](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md) enabled. If testing identifies file locking or other blocking issues, determine whether to disable [real-time protection](configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) and configure [scheduled scans](schedule-antivirus-scans.md). If testing identifies problems, open a [support case](contact-support.md) using the Microsoft Defender portal. 

2. Exclude DBMS files and executables following your DBMS vendor recommendations.

3. Analyze SAPMNT, SAP TRANS_DIR, Spool and Job Log directories. If there are more than 100,000 files, consider archiving to reduce the number of files.

4. Confirm the performance limits and quotas of the shared file system used for SAPMNT. The SMB share source could be a NetApp appliance, a Windows server shared disk or Azure Files SMB. 

5. Configure exclusions such that all SAP application servers are not scanning the SAPMNT share simultaneously as this may overload shared storage server.

6. In general, host interface files on a dedicated non-SAP file server. Interface files are recognized as an attack vector. Real-time protection should be activated on this dedicated file server. SAP Servers should never be used as file servers for interface files. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Some large SAP systems have more than 20 SAP application servers each with a connection to the same SAPMNT SMB share. 20 application servers simultaneously scanning the same SMB server may overload the SMB server. It is recommended to exclude SAPMNT from regular scans. 
> 
## Important configuration settings for Defender for Endpoint on Windows Server with SAP

1. Get an overview of [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The term *Defender* is sometimes used to refer to an entire suite of products and solutions. See [What is Microsoft Defender XDR?](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender). In this article, we focus on Defender for Endpoint.

    
2. To check Microsoft Defender Antivirus status, open Command Prompt and then run these PowerShell commands:

   - `Get-MpComputerStatus`
   - `Get-MpPreference`

   The most significant settings for SAP are as follows:

   ```powershell
   Get-MpPreference |Select-Object -Property  DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans, DisableRealtimeMonitoring, DisableScanningMappedNetworkDrivesForFullScan , DisableScanningNetworkFiles, ExclusionPath, MAPSReporting 

   Get-MpComputerStatus |Select-Object -Property AMRunningMode, AntivirusEnabled, BehaviorMonitorEnabled, IsTamperProtected , OnAccessProtectionEnabled, RealTimeProtectionEnabled

   ```
   
3. To check Defender for Endpoint EDR status, in Command Prompt, run the following command:

   `PS C:\Windows\System32> Get-Service -Name sense | FL *`

   You should see output that resembles the following:

   ```powershell

   Name        : sense
   RequiredServices  : {}
   CanPauseAndContinue : False
   CanShutdown     : False
   CanStop       : False
   DisplayName     : Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Service
   DependentServices  : {}
   MachineName     : .
   ServiceName     : sense
   ServicesDependedOn : {}
   ServiceHandle    :
   Status       : Running
   ServiceType     : Win32OwnProcess
   StartType      : Automatic
   Site        :
   Container      :

   ```

   The values you want to see are `Status: Running` and `StartType: Automatic`.
   
   For more information about the output, see [Review events and errors using Event Viewer](event-error-codes.md).

4. To check whether Microsoft Defender Antivirus software components are up to date, use Windows Update. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus isn't up to date, or if you get an error, contact your security team. For more infomration about updates, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus security intelligence and product updates](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md).

5. Make sure [behavior monitoring](behavioral-blocking-containment.md) is turned on. If tamper protection is enabled, behavior monitoring is turned on by default. Use the default configuration of tamper protection enabled, behavior monitoring enabled, and real-time monitoring enabled unless a specific problem is identified. For more information, see [Built-in protection helps guard against ransomware](built-in-protection.md).

6. Make sure [real-time protection is enabled](configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md). The current recommendation for Defender for Endpoint on Windows is to enable real-time scanning, with tamper protection enabled, behavior monitoring enabled, and real-time monitoring enabled, unless a specific problem has been identified.  

7. Keep in mind how scans work with network shares. By default, the Microsoft Defender Antivirus component on Windows scans SMB shared network file systems (for example, a Windows server share `\\server\smb-share` or a NetApp share) when these files are accessed by processes. 

   [Defender for Endpoint EDR](overview-endpoint-detection-response.md) on Windows might scan SMB shared network file systems. The EDR sensor scans certain files that are identified as interesting for EDR analysis during file modification, delete and move operations.

   Defender for Endpoint on Linux does not scan NFS file systems during scheduled scans. 

8. To troubleshoot sense health or reliability issues, use the [Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer tool](overview-client-analyzer.md). The Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer an be useful when diagnosing sensor health or reliability issues on onboarded devices running either Windows, Linux, or macOS. 

   Get the latest version of the Defender for Endpoint Client Analyzer here: [https://aka.ms/MDEAnalyzer](https://aka.ms/MDEAnalyzer).

9. To open a support case, see [Contact Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support](contact-support.md).

10. If you're using production SAP VMs with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, keep in mind that Defender for Cloud deploys the Defender for Endpoint extension to all VMs. If a VM isn't onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, it could be used as an attack vector. If you need more time to test Defender for Endpoint before deplying to your production environment, [contact support](contact-support.md). 

## Useful Commands: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with SAP on Windows Server

### Update Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions manually

Use Windows Update, or run the following command:

`PS C:\Program Files\Windows Defender> .\MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate`

You should see an output that resembles the following code snippet:

```properties
Signature update started . . .
Service Version: 4.18.23050.9
Engine Version: 1.1.23060.1005
AntiSpyware Signature Version: 1.393.925.0
Antivirus Signature Version: 1.393.925.0
Signature update finished.
PS C:\Program Files\Windows Defender>
```

Another option is to use this command: 

`PS C:\Program Files\Windows Defender> Update-MpSignature`

### Determine whether EDR in block mode is turned on

[EDR in block mode](edr-in-block-mode.md) provides added protection from malicious artifacts when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not the primary antivirus product and is running in passive mode. You can determine whether EDR in block mode is enabled by running the following command:

`Get-MPComputerStatus|select AMRunningMode`

There are two modes: Normal and Passive Mode. Testing with SAP systems has only been completed with `AMRunningMode = Normal` for SAP systems. 

### Configure antivirus exclusions

Before you configure exclusions, make sure that the SAP Basis Team coordinates with your security team.  Exclusions should be configured centrally and not at the VM level. Exclusions such as the shared SAPMNT file system should be excluded via a policy using the Intune admin tool.

To view exclusions, use the following command:

`Get-MpPreference | Select-Object -Property ExclusionPath`

For more information about exclusions, see the following resources:

- [Manage exclusions for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Antivirus](defender-endpoint-antivirus-exclusions.md)
- [Configure custom exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md)

### Configure EDR exclusions

It is not recommended to exclude files, paths or processes from EDR as this comprises the protection from modern non-file based threats. If required, open a support case with Microsoft Support via the Microsoft Defender portal specifying executables and/or paths to exclude. See [Contact Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support](contact-support.md).

### Completely disable Defender for Endpoint on Windows for testing purposes

> [!WARNING]
> It is not recommended to disable security software unless there is no alternative to solve or isolate a problem. 

Defender for Endpoint should be configured with [tamper protection](prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection.md) turned on. To temporarily disable Defender for Endpoint to isolate problems, it is recommended to use [troubleshooting mode](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-troubleshooting-mode).

To shut down various subcomponents of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus solution, run the following commands:

```powershell
Set-MPPreference -DisableTamperProtection $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Disabled
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Disabled 
```

You cannot turn off EDR subcomponents on a device. The only way to turn EDR off is to [offboard the device](configure-endpoints-script.md#offboard-devices-using-a-local-script).

To turn off [cloud-delivered protection](cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) (Microsoft Advanced Protection Service, or MAPS), run the following commands:

```powershell
PowerShell Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting 0â€‹
PowerShell Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Disabledâ€‹
```

For more information about cloud-delivered protection, see the following resources:

- [Cloud protection and Microsoft Defender Antivirus](cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md)
- [Cloud protection and sample submission at Microsoft Defender Antivirus](cloud-protection-microsoft-antivirus-sample-submission.md) (You might want to consider whether to use automatic sample submission with your security policies)
