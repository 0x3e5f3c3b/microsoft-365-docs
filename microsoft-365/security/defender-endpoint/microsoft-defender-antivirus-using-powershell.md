# Evaluate Microsoft Defender Antivirus using Powershell

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)

In Windows 10 or newer and Windows Server 2016 or newer you can use next-generation protection features offered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Microsoft Defender AV) and Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard (Microsoft Defender EG).

This topic explains how to enable and test the key protection features in Microsoft Defender AV and Microsoft Defender EG, and provides you with guidance and links to more information.  
We recommend you use this evaluation PowerShell script to configure these features, but you can individually enable each feature with the cmdlets described in the rest of this document.
