# Microsoft Defender Antivirus in Windows

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/)


Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a major component of your next-generation protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This protection brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices (or endpoints) in your organization. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is built into Windows, and it works with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide protection on your device and in the cloud. 

## Compatibility with other antivirus products

If you're using a non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware product on your device, depending on the operating system and whether your device is onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, you might be able to run Microsoft Defender Antivirus in passive mode alongside the non-Microsoft antivirus solution. To learn more, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus compatibility](microsoft-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md).

## Platform updates

Microsoft releases regular updates to help ensure that your devices have the latest technology to protect against new malware and attack techniques. To learn more, see [Manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and apply baselines](manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).
