# Migrating from a third-party HIPS to ASR rules

This article helps you to map common rules to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The following table shows common questions and scenarios when migrating from a third-party HIPS product to ASR rules.

|||||||
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Scope and Action|Processes|Operation|Examples of Files/Folders, Registry Keys/Values, Processes, Services|Attack Surface Reduction rules|Other recommended features|
|All Processes: Block creation of specific files and registry keys||File Creation|*.zepto, *.odin, *.locky, *.jaff, *.lukitus, *.wnry, *.krab|ASR rules block the attack techniques and not the Indicators of Compromise (IOC). Blocking a specific file extension is not always useful, because it does not prevent a device from compromise. It only partially thwarts an  attack until attackers create a new type of extension for the payload.|Having Microsoft Defender AV enabled, along with Cloud Protection and Behavior Analysis is highly recommended. We recommended you use other prevention, such as the ASR rule "Use advanced protection against ransomware". This provides a greater level of protection against ransomware attacks. Furthermore, several of these registry keys are monitored by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, such as ASEP techniques, which will trigger specific alerts. The registry keys used require a minimum of Local Admin or Trusted Installer privileges to be able to be modified. Using a locked down environment, with minimum administrative accounts or rights, is recommended. Other system configurations can be enabled, including "Disable SeDebug for non-required roles" that are part of our wider security recommendations.|

We recommended you use additional prevention, such as the ASR rule "Use advanced protection against ransomware". This provides a greater level of protection against ransomware attacks.

|Untrusted Programs from USB: Block untrusted programs from running from removable drives|*|Process Execution|*|ASR rules have a built-in rule to prevent the launch of untrusted and unsigned programs from removable drives:  "Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB", GUID "b2b3f03d-6a65-4f7b-a9c7-1c7ef74a9ba4".|Please explore additional controls for USB devices and other removable media using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/device-control/control-usb-devices-using-intune.|
|Mshta: Block Mshta from launching certain child processes|mshta.exe|Process Execution|powershell.exe, cmd.exe, regsvr32.exe|ASR rules don't contain any specific rule to prevent child processes from "mshta.exe". This control is within the remit of Exploit Protection or Windows Defender Application Control.|Enable Windows Defender Application Control to prevent mshta.exe from being executed altogether. If your organization requires "mshta.exe" for line of business apps,  configure a specific Windows Defender Exploit Protection rule, in order to prevent mshta.exe from launching child processes.|
|Outlook: Block Outlook from launching child processes|outlook.exe|Process Execution|powershell.exe|ASR rules have a built-in rule to prevent Office communication apps (Outlook, Skype and Teams) from launching child processes: "Block Office communication application from creating child processes", GUID "26190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869".|We recommend enabling PowerShell constrained language mode, in order to minimize the attack surface from PowerShell.|
|Office: Block Office Apps from launching child processes and from creating executable content|winword.exe, powerpnt.exe, excel.exe|Process Execution|powershell.exe, cmd.exe, wscript.exe, mshta.exe, EQNEDT32.EXE, regsrv32.exe|ASR rules have a built-in rule to prevent Office apps from launching child processes:  "Block all Office applications from creating child processes", GUID "D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A".|N/A|
|Office: Block Office Apps from launching child processes and from creating executable content|winword.exe, powerpnt.exe, excel.exe|File Creation|C:\Users\*\AppData\**\*.exe, C:\ProgramData\**\*.exe, C:\ProgramData\**\*.com, C:\Users\*AppData\Local\Temp\**\*.com, C:\Users\**\Downloads\**\*.exe, C:\Users\*\AppData\**\*.scf, C:\ProgramData\**\*.scf, C:\Users\Public\*.exe, C:\Users\*\Desktop\**\*.exe|N/A|
|Wscript: Block Wscript from reading certain types of files|wscript.exe|File Read|C:\Users\*\AppData\**\*.js*, C:\Users\*\Downloads\**\*.js*|Due to reliability and performance issues, ASR rules do not have the capability to prevent a specific process from reading a certain script file type. We do have a rule to prevent attack vectors that might originate from these scenarios. The rule name is "Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content" (GUID "D3E037E1-3EB8-44C8-A917-57927947596D") and the "Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts" (GUID " 5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC")|Though there are specific ASR rules that mitigate certain attack vectors within these scenarios, it's important to mention that AV is able by default to inspect scripts (PowerShell, Windows Script Host, JavaScript, VBScript, and more) in real time, through the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). More info is available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal.|
|Adobe Acrobat: Block launch of child processes|AcroRd32.exe, Acrobat.exe|Process Execution|cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe|ASR rules allow blocking Adobe Reader from launching child processes. The rule name is "Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes", GUID "7674ba52-37eb-4a4f-a9a1-f0f9a1619a2c".|N/A|
|CertUtil: Block download or creation of executable content|certutil.exe|File Creation|*.exe|ASR rules don't support these scenarios because they're part of Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection.|Microsoft Defender AV prevents CertUtil from creating or downloading executable content.|
|All Processes: Block processes from stopping critical System components|*|Process Termination|MsSense.exe, MsMpEng.exe, NisSrv.exe, svchost.exe*, services.exe, csrss.exe, smss.exe, wininit.exe, and more.|ASR rules don't support these scenarios because they're protected with Windows 10 built-in security protections.|ELAM (Early Launch AntiMalware), PPL (Protection Process Light), PPL AntiMalware Light, and System Guard.|
|Specific Processes: Block specific launch Process Attempt|"Name your Process"|Process Execution|tor.exe, bittorrent.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and more.|Overall, ASR rules aren't designed to function as an Application manager.|To prevent users from launching specific processes or programs, the recommendation would be to use Windows Defender Application Control. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint File and Cert indicators, can be used in an Incident Response scenario (should not be seen as an application control mechanism).|
|All Processes: Block unauthorized changes to MDATP AV configurations|*|Registry Modifications|HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\DisableAntiSpyware, HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Policy Manager\AllowRealTimeMonitoring, etc.|ASR rules don't cover these kinds of scenarios because they are part of the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint built-in protection.|Tamper Protection (opt-in, managed from Intune) prevents unauthorized changes to DisableAntiVirus, DisableAntiSpyware, DisableRealtimeMonitoring, DisableOnAccessProtection, DisableBehaviorMonitoring and DisableIOAVProtection registry keys (and more).|
