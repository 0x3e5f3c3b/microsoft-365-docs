## Microsoft Secure score
Microsoft Secure Score is a measurement of an organization's security posture. A higher number indicates more recommended actions taken and a better posture and overall ability to predict, prevent, and respond to threats. The secure score card shows how the overall cybersecurity strength of an organization has improved in the past month and how it compares to other companies with similar number of managed devices.

## Secure score compared to other organizations 
This score is an evaluation of an organization's security score in relation to organizations of a similar size. It's a way to benchmark an organization's performance in implementing security measures compared to other organizations. 


## Devices onboarded
Devices must be onboarded to the service so that they can be protected. The devices card provides information on the number of devices that were onboarded in the last month as well as devices not yet onboarded. 

## Protection against threats
This card shows how resilient your organization is to specific attacks. A higher number indicates better defense in place against phishing and ransomware. You'll also see how the protection increased in the last month. 

## Web content monitoring and filtering 
Shows the number of malicious URLs that were blocked in the last month. You'll also see the categories of URLs that were blocked and the number of clicks for each category. 

## Suspicious or malicious activities
Track how many incidents and alerts were resolved in the past month using the incidents card. The card also shows all active incidents and alerts. You'll also be able to see a list of the top 10 severe incidents, their status, number of alerts, and the impacted devices and users.
