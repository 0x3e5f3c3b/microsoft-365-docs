You'll need to decide which deployment method to use. The deployment tool you choose influences how you onboard endpoints to the service. For information on the available tools based on the endpoint that you need to onboard, see [Select deployment method](../defender-endpoint/deployment-strategy.md#step-2-select-deployment-method).

## Example deployments

In this deployment guide, we'll guide you through using two deployment tools to onboard endpoints and how to configure capabilities.

The tools in the example deployments are:

- [Onboarding using Microsoft Configuration Manager](onboarding-endpoint-configuration-manager.md)
- [Onboarding using Microsoft Intune](onboarding-endpoint-manager.md)

Using the mentioned deployment tools above, you'll then be guided in configuring the following Defender for Endpoint capabilities:

- Endpoint detection and response configuration
- Next-generation protection configuration
- Attack surface reduction configuration

## Next step

After onboarding the endpoints proceed to Step 4 where you'll configure the various capabilities such as endpoint detection and response, next-generation protection, and attack surface reduction:
