To start onboarding your devices:

1. Go to [Select deployment method](../defender-endpoint/deployment-strategy.md#step-2-select-deployment-method)
2. Choose the Operating System for the devices you wish to Onboard.
3. Select the tool you plan to use.
4. Follow the instructions to Onboard your devices.

This video provides a quick overview of the onboarding process and the different tools and methods.

## Example deployments

To provide some guidance on your deployments, in this section we'll guide you through using two deployment tools to onboard endpoints.

The tools in the example deployments are:

- [Onboarding using Microsoft Configuration Manager](onboarding-endpoint-configuration-manager.md)
- [Onboarding using Microsoft Intune](onboarding-endpoint-manager.md)

The example deployments will guide you on configuring some of the Defender for Endpoint capabilities, but you'll find more detailed information on configuring Defender for Endpoint capabilities in the [next step](#next-step).

## Next step

After onboarding the endpoints move on to the next step where you'll configure the various capabilities such as endpoint detection and response, next-generation protection, and attack surface reduction.
