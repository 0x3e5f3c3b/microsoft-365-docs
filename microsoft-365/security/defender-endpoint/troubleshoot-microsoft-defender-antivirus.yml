## Microsoft Defender Antivirus event IDs

Microsoft Defender Antivirus records event IDs in the Windows event log.

You can directly view the event log, or if you have a third-party security information and event management (SIEM) tool, you can also consume [Microsoft Defender Antivirus client event IDs](troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md#windows-defender-av-ids) to review specific events and errors from your endpoints.

The table in this section lists the main Microsoft Defender Antivirus event IDs and, where possible, provides suggested solutions to fix or resolve the error.

## To view a Microsoft Defender Antivirus event

 1. Open **Event Viewer**.
 2. In the console tree, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, then **Microsoft**, then **Windows**, then **Windows Defender**.
 3. Double-click on **Operational**.
 4. In the details pane, view the list of individual events to find your event.
 5. Click the event to see specific details about an event in the lower pane, under the **General** and **Details** tabs.
