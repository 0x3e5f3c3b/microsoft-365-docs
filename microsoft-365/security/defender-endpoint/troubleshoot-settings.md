# Troubleshoot Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-business)
- [Microsoft Defender for Individuals](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides numerous ways to manage the product, which provides small and medium-sized businesses as well as enterprise organizations with flexibility by working with the management tools that they already have.

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management
- Microsoft Intune (MDM)
- Microsoft Configuration Manager with Tenant Attach
- Microsoft Configuration Manager Co-Management
- Microsoft Configuration Manager (standalone)
- Group Policy (GPO)
- PowerShell
- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- Registry

> [!TIP]
> As a best practice, try sticking to one method of managing Microsoft Defender for Antivirus. 

## Example: You're migrating from a non-Microsoft antivirus product and when you try enabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it won't start.

You can narrow down the issue with this registry key: `DisableAntispyware` (dword) 1 (hex) is set.

Our current recommendation is as follows:

1. (**Preferred**) Remove conflicting policies in GPO, Configuration Manager, your MDM tools, and/or non-Microsoft management solutions when moving to Defender for Endpoint security settings management or Intune for policy management.

   When policies and settings are configure in multiple tools, in general, here's the order of precedence:

   1. Group Policy (GPO)
   2. Microsoft Configuration Manager Co-Management
   3. Microsoft Configuration Manager (standalone)
   4. Microsoft Intune (MDM)
   5. Microsoft Configuration Manager with Tenant Attach
   6. PowerShell ([Set-MpPreference](/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference)), [MpCmdRun.exe](command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md), or [Windows Management Instrumentation](use-wmi-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md) (WMI).

   > [!WARNING]
   > [MDMWinsOverGP](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-controlpolicyconflict) which is a Policy (CSP) does not apply for all settings such as Attack Surface Reduction rules (ASR rules) in Windows 10.

2. Find out whether Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings are coming through a policy, MDM, or a local setting. The following table describes policies, settings, and relevant tools.

|Policy or setting| Registry location | Tools|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Policy| `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\<Policies>\Microsoft\Windows Defender`|- Microsoft Configuration Manager Co-Management<br/>- Microsoft Configuration Manager<br/>- GPO|
|MDM|`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\<Policy Manager>` |- Microsoft Intune (MDM)<br/>- Microsoft Configuration Manager with Tenant Attach|
|Local setting|`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\<Windows Defender>`|- MpCmdRun.exe<br/>- PowerShell (Set-MpPreference)<br/>- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)|

3. Find the name of the policy. The following table describes how to identify policies and settings.

|Method used | What to check |
| -------- | -------- |
|Policy| - If you're using GPO: Select **Start**, open Command Prompt as an administrator, and then run the command `GpResult.exe /h C:\temp\GpResult_output.html`. <br/>- If you're using Microsoft Configuration Manager Co-Management or Microsoft Configuration Manager (standalone), go to `C:\Windows\CCM\Logs`.|
|MDM | If you're using Intune, on your device, select Start, open Command Prompt as an admin, and then run the command `mdmdiagnosticstool.exe -zip "c:\temp\MDMDiagReport.zip"`. See [Collect MDM logs - Windows Client Management](/windows/client-management/mdm-collect-logs). |
|Local setting | Determine whether the policy or setting was deployed during the imaging (sysprep), via Powershell (e.g. Set-MpPreference), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), or through a direct modification to the registry.|

4. Once you have identified the conflicting policy, work with your security administrators to change device targeting so that devices receive the correct Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings.
