Find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about device discovery.

## What is Basic discovery mode?

This mode allows every Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarded device to collect network data and discover neighboring devices. Onboarded endpoints passively collect events in the network and extract device information from them. No network traffic will be initiated. Onboarded endpoints will simply extract data from every network traffic that is seen by an onboarded device. This data used to list unmanaged devices in your network.

## Can I control which devices perform Standard discovery?

You can customize the list of devices that are used to perform Standard discovery. You can either enable Standard discovery on all the onboarded devices that also support this capability (currently Windows 10 or later and Windows Server 2019 or later devices only) or select a subset or subsets of your devices by specifying their device tags. In this case, all other devices will be configured to run Basic discovery only. The configuration is available in the device discovery settings page.

## Can I exclude unmanaged devices from the device inventory list?

Yes, you can apply filters to exclude unmanaged devices from the device inventory list. You can also use the onboarding status column on API queries to filter out unmanaged devices.

## Which onboarded devices can perform discovery?

Onboarded devices running on Windows 10 version 1809 or later, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022 can perform discovery.

## What happens if my onboarded devices is connected to my home network, or to public access point?

The discovery engine distinguishes between network events that are received in the corporate network versus outside of the corporate network. By correlating network identifiers across all tenant's clients, events are differentiated between ones that were received from private networks and corporate networks. For example, if the majority of the devices in the organization report that they are connected to the same network name, with the same default gateway and DHCP server address, it can be assumed that this network is likely a corporate network. Private network devices will not be listed in the inventory and will not be actively probed.

## What protocols are you capturing and analyzing?

By default, all onboarded devices running on Windows 10 version 1809 or later, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022 are capturing and analyzing the following protocols:
ARP, CDP, DHCP, DHCPv6, IP (headers), LLDP, LLMNR, mDNS, MNDP, NBNS, SSDP, TCP (SYN headers), UDP (headers), WSD

## Can I exclude devices from being discovered?

As device discovery uses passive methods to discover devices in the network, any device that communicates with your onboarded devices in the corporate network can be discovered and listed in the inventory. You can exclude devices from active probing only.

## Why is there a discrepancy between "can be onboarded" devices in the device inventory, and the number of "devices to onboard" in the dashboard tile?

You may notice differences between the number of listed devices under "can be onboarded" in the device inventory, "onboard to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint" security recommendation, and "devices to onboard" dashboard widget.

 The security recommendation and the dashboard widget are for devices that are stable in the network; excluding ephemeral devices, guest devices and others. The idea is to recommend on persistent devices, that also imply on the overall security score of the organization.

## Can I onboard unmanaged devices that were found?

Yes. You can onboard unmanaged devices manually. Unmanaged endpoints in your network introduce vulnerabilities and risks to your network. Onboarding them to the service can increase the security visibility on them.
