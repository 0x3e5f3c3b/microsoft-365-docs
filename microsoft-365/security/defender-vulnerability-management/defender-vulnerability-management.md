**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Reducing cyber risk requires comprehensive risk-based vulnerability management to identify, assess, remediate, and track all your biggest vulnerabilities across your most critical assets, all in a single solution.

Defender Vulnerability Management delivers asset visibility, intelligent assessments, and built-in remediation tools for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and network devices. Leveraging Microsoft threat intelligence, breach likelihood predications, business contexts, and devices assessments, Defender Vulnerability Management rapidly and continuously prioritizes the biggest vulnerabilities on your most critical assets and provides security recommendations to mitigate risk.

> [!TIP]
> As of May 12, 2022, Defender Vulnerability Management will be available as a new standalone offering, and as an add-on to Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 that enhances its existing core vulnerability management capabilities. For more information on the features and capabilities that are included in each offering, see [Compare Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management offerings.](defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities.md)

With Defender Vulnerability Management you can empower your security and IT teams to bridge workflow gaps and prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization. Reduce cyber security risk with:

- **Asset discovery & inventory**

- **Vulnerability & configuration assessment**

- **Risk-based intelligent prioritization**




## Asset discovery & inventory​

Defender Vulnerability Management provides continuous asset discovery and a real-time consolidated view of your organization's software applications, digital certificates, network shares, and browser extensions in a single inventory view.

Continuous monitoring and risk detection by built-in and agentless scanners, allows you to detect risk for managed and unmanaged devices even when devices aren’t connected to the corporate network.

It also provides:

- **Real-time device inventory** - Devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint automatically report and push vulnerability and security configuration data to the dashboard.
- **Visibility into software and vulnerabilities** - Optics into the organization's software inventory, and software changes like installations, uninstalls, and patches. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are reported with actionable mitigation recommendations for 1st and 3rd party applications.
- **Application runtime context** - Visibility on application usage patterns for better prioritization and decision-making.
- **Configuration posture** - Visibility into organizational security configuration or misconfigurations. Issues are reported in the dashboard with actionable security recommendations.

## Vulnerability & configuration assessment

Defender Vulnerability Management uses built-in agentless scanners to detect risk even when devices are not connected to the corporate network.

Built-in and agentless scanners allow you to 

It also provides:

Access consolidated inventories across software applications, digital certificates, browser extensions, and network shares. View information on extension permissions and associated risk levels, identify certificates before they expire, detect potential vulnerabilities due to weak signature algorithms, and assess misconfigurations in internal network​ - Understand your cyber exposure and relevant threat and business contexts in one place. Proactively prevent breaches with risk assessments leveraging industry standards, including CIS and STIG.​

**Visibility into software and vulnerabilities** - Optics into the organization's software inventory, and software changes like installations, uninstalls, and patches. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are reported with actionable mitigation recommendations for 1st and 3rd party applications.
**Application runtime context** - Visibility on application usage patterns for better prioritization and decision-making.
**Configuration posture** - Visibility into organizational security configuration or misconfigurations. Issues are reported in the dashboard with actionable security recommendations.

## Risk-based intelligent prioritization

Defender Vulnerability Management leverage Microsoft’s threat intelligence, breach likelihood predictions, business contexts, and device assessments to quickly prioritize the biggest vulnerabilities in your organization. A single view of prioritized recommendations from multiple security feeds, along with critical details including related CVEs and exposed devices helps you quickly remediate the biggest vulnerabilities on your most critical assets. Risk-based intelligent prioritization:

- **Focuses on emerging threats** - Dynamically aligns the prioritization of security recommendations with vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild and emerging threats that pose the highest risk.
- **Pinpoints active breaches** - Correlates vulnerability management and EDR insights to prioritize vulnerabilities being exploited in an active breach within the organization.
- **Protects high-value assets** - Identifies exposed devices with business-critical applications, confidential data, or high-value users.  

## Remediation and tracking ​

Bridge the gap between teams with real-time remediation tracking and posture measurement. Allows security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate and seamlessly remediate issues with built-in workflows.

- **Remediation requests sent to IT** - Create a remediation task in Microsoft Intune from a specific security recommendation. 
- **Block vulnerable applications** -  Mitigate risk with the ability to [block vulnerable applications](tvm-block-vuln-apps.md) for specific device groups.
- **Alternate mitigations** - Gain insights on additional mitigations, such as configuration changes that can reduce risk associated with software vulnerabilities.
- **Real-time remediation status** - Real-time monitoring of the status and progress of remediation activities across the organization.
