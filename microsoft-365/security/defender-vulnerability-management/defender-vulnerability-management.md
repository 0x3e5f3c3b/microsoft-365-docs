**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Reducing cyber risk requires comprehensive risk-based vulnerability management to identify, assess, remediate, and track all your biggest vulnerabilities across your most critical assets, all in a single solution.

Defender Vulnerability Management delivers asset visibility, intelligent assessments, and built-in remediation tools for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and network devices. Leveraging Microsoft threat intelligence, breach likelihood predications, business contexts, and devices assessments, Defender Vulnerability Management rapidly and continuously prioritizes the biggest vulnerabilities on your most critical assets and provides security recommendations to mitigate risk.

> [!TIP]
> As of May 12, 2022, Defender Vulnerability Management will be available as a new standalone offering, and as an add-on to Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 that enhances its existing core vulnerability management capabilities. For more information on the features and capabilities that are included in each option, see [Compare Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management offerings.](defender-vulnerability-management-capabilities.md)

With Defender Vulnerability Management you can empower your security and IT teams to bridge workflow gaps and prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization.

Reduce cyber security risk with continuous vulnerability discovery and assessment, risk-based prioritization, and remediation.​

## Asset discovery & inventory

Continuously detect risk across managed and unmanaged endpoints with built-in modules and agentless scanners, even when devices aren’t connected to the corporate network. View entity-level risk assessment data to focus on your most critical assets.Discover and assess all your organization’s assets in a single view. Eliminate periodic scans with continuous monitoring and alerts. Detect risk even when devices are not connected to the corporate network.​ what to assess in a single view.

To discover endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfiguration,vulnerability management uses the same agentless built-in Defender for Endpoint sensors to reduce cumbersome network scans and IT overhead.

It also provides:
*Real-time device inventory  Devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint automatically report and push vulnerability and security configuration data to the dashboard.

## Vulnerability & configuration assessment

Access consolidated inventories across software applications, digital certificates, browser extensions, and network shares. View information on extension permissions and associated risk levels, identify certificates before they expire, detect potential vulnerabilities due to weak signature algorithms, and assess misconfigurations in internal network​ - Understand your cyber exposure and relevant threat and business contexts in one place. Proactively prevent breaches with risk assessments leveraging industry standards, including CIS and STIG.​

**Visibility into software and vulnerabilities** - Optics into the organization's software inventory, and software changes like installations, uninstalls, and patches. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are reported with actionable mitigation recommendations for 1st and 3rd party applications.
**Application runtime context** - Visibility on application usage patterns for better prioritization and decision-making.
**Configuration posture** - Visibility into organizational security configuration or misconfigurations. Issues are reported in the dashboard with actionable security recommendations.

## Risk-based intelligent prioritization

Quickly remediate the biggest vulnerabilities on your most critical assets. Prioritize risks using Microsoft threat intelligence, likelihood predictions, event timelines, and device reports.​Use Microsoft threat intelligence, breach likelihood analysis, event timelines, and entity-level vulnerability assessments to understand and prioritize vulnerabilities.  Focus on threats that pose the highest risk with a single view of prioritized recommendations from multiple security feeds. Access critical details including related CVEs, exposed devices, and more - Expert-level threat monitoring - Prioritized security recommendations ​​
and analysis​

Threat and vulnerability management helps customers prioritize and focus on the weaknesses that pose the most urgent and the highest risk to the organization. It fuses security recommendations with dynamic threat and business context:

- **Exposing emerging attacks in the wild** - Dynamically aligns the prioritization of security recommendations. Threat and vulnerability management focuses on vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild and emerging threats that pose the highest risk.
- **Pinpointing active breaches** - Correlates threat and vulnerability management and EDR insights to prioritize vulnerabilities being exploited in an active breach within the organization.
- **Protecting high-value assets** - Identify the exposed devices with business-critical applications, confidential data, or high-value users.

## Remediation and tracking

Threat and vulnerability management allows security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate seamlessly to remediate issues.

- **Remediation requests sent to IT** - Create a remediation task in Microsoft Intune from a specific security recommendation. We plan to expand this capability to other IT security management platforms.
- **Alternate mitigations** - Gain insights on additional mitigations, such as configuration changes that can reduce risk associated with software vulnerabilities.
- **Real-time remediation status** - Real-time monitoring of the status and progress of remediation activities across the organization.
