When it comes addressing vulnerabilities in your organization, a robust update process is a key component in a comprehensive vulnerability management solution. Devices often require a restart during the update process so the ability to known if an update hasn't completed due to a pending restart, and how many devices have a restart pending, means you can take action on these devices so they will be protected. If devices have a restart pending, the impact of taking the security recommendation will not be reflected in your organizations exposure score.

The **Pending restart** tag in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability management will help to identify devices in this state and where action might be needed to completed an update.

This tag can help you understand why some update actions taken are not yet reflected in the exposure as some devices require restarts in order to complete an update.

> [!NOTE]
> The tag is currently available for Windows(OS) updates, and KB corrections.
