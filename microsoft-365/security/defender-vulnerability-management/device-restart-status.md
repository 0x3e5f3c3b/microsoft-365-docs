A robust patching process is a key component in a comprehensive vulnerability management solution. Understanding the status of 

Each security recommendation includes actionable remediation steps. Taking remeidtion actions can have an impact impact on your exposure score. For more
information about the impact on exposure socre see 

To help organizations better track patching status, we developed a new capability that will allow you to track the status of the devices during the patching process that will indicate if the patching has failed due to a pending restart and how many devices are pending a restart.

We have created this new feature with intent to explain the gap between how update actions taken are not yet reflected in the exposure metrics, that can occur in many cases, due to the fact that some devices require restarts in order to complete an update.

There are various places in Defender Vulnerability Management where you can find this indication. A pending restart tag is now available with the security recommendations. On the software page, this indication appears as part of the missing KBs section. As a first step, this new capability covers Windows (OS) updates, and KB corrections. Please stay tuned, as we plan to extend this feature to many other operating systems in the future.

## View the device restart status

The device restart status is visible in following the following experiences in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

### Security recommendations page

On the security recommendations pages, you can view clear suggestions about remediation and mitigation options, including workarounds if they exist. Filter by the "zero day" tag to only see security recommendations addressing zero-day vulnerabilities.

If there's software with a zero-day vulnerability and additional vulnerabilities to address, you'll get one recommendation about all vulnerabilities.

### Software page

Look for a zero-day tag for each software that has been affected by the zero-day vulnerability.

## Addressing zero-day vulnerabilities

Go to the security recommendation page and select a recommendation with a zero-day. A flyout will open with information about the zero-day and other vulnerabilities for that software.

There will be a link to mitigation options and workarounds if they are available. Workarounds may help reduce the risk posed by this zero-day vulnerability until a patch or security update can be deployed.

Open remediation options and choose the attention type. An "attention required" remediation option is recommended for the zero-day vulnerabilities, since an update hasn't been released yet. You won't be able to select a due date, since there's no specific action to perform. If there are older vulnerabilities for this software you wish to remediation, you can override the "attention required" remediation option and choose "update."

## Track zero-day remediation activities

Go to the [Remediation](tvm-remediation.md) page to view the remediation activity item. If you chose the "attention required" remediation option, there will be no progress bar, ticket status, or due date since there's no actual action we can monitor. You can filter by remediation type, such as "software update" or "attention required," to see all activity items in the same category.
