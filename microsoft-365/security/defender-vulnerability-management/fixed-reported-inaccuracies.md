# Fixed customer reported inaccuracies

The report inaccuracy capabilities provides a way to report false positive, inaccurate, or incomplete information identified in Weaknesses and Recommendations in the [Microsoft Defender 365 portal](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage). Microsoft uses the information in reported inaccuracies to:

- Help update and correct the data for the organization that reported the inaccuracy
- As a basis to continue to improve our vulnerability management capabilities
