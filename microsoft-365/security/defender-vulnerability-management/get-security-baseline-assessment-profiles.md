# Export security baselines assessment per device 

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)


## 2. List all security baselines assessment profiles

Returns all of the installed software and their details on each device.

### 2.1 Methods

|Method|Data type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Export software inventory assessment **(JSON response)**|Software inventory by device collection. See: [2.2 Properties (JSON response)](#22-properties-json-response)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion. The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for small organizations with less than 100-K devices. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results. |
| Export software inventory assessment **(via files)**|Software inventory by device files. See: [2.3 Properties (via files)](#23-properties-via-files)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion. This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download data from Azure Storage as follows: <ol><li>Call the API to get a list of download URLs with your organization data</li><li>Download the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.</li></ol> |

### 2.2 Properties (JSON response)

Property (ID)|Data type|Description
:---|:---|:---
DeviceId|String|Unique identifier for the device in the service.
DeviceName|String|Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the device.
DiskPaths|Array[string]|Disk evidence that the product is installed on the device.
EndOfSupportDate|String|The date in which support for this software has or will end.
EndOfSupportStatus|String|End of support status. Can contain these possible values: None, EOS Version, Upcoming EOS Version, EOS Software, Upcoming EOS Software.
NumberOfWeaknesses|Int|Number of weaknesses on this software on this device.
OSPlatform|String|Platform of the operating system running on the device; specific operating systems with variations within the same family, such as Windows 10 and Windows 11. See tvm supported operating systems and platforms for details.
RbacGroupName|String|The role-based access control (RBAC) group. If this device isn't assigned to any RBAC group, the value will be "Unassigned." If the organization doesn't contain any RBAC groups, the value will be "None."
rbacGroupId|String|The role-based access control (RBAC) group ID.
RegistryPaths|Array[string]|Registry evidence that the product is installed in the device.
SoftwareFirstSeenTimestamp|String|The first time this software was seen on the device.
SoftwareName|String|Name of the software product.
SoftwareVendor|String|Name of the software vendor.
SoftwareVersion|String|Version number of the software product.

### 2.3 Properties (via files)

Property (ID)|Data type|Description
:---|:---|:---
Export files|array\[string\]|A list of download URLs for files holding the current snapshot of the organization.
GeneratedTime|String|The time that the export was generated.

## 3. List all security baselines assessment configurations 

Returns all the known vulnerabilities on a device and their details, for all devices.

### 3.1 Methods

Method|Data type|Description
:---|:---|:---
Export software vulnerabilities assessment **(JSON response)**|Investigation collection See: [3.2 Properties (JSON response)](#32-properties-json-response)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId. The API pulls all data in your organization as JSON responses. This method is best for small organizations with less than 100-K devices. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results.
Export software vulnerabilities assessment **(via files)**|Investigation entity See: [3.3 Properties (via files)](#33-properties-via-files)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId. This API solution enables pulling larger amounts of data faster and more reliably. So, it's recommended for large organizations, with more than 100-K devices. This API pulls all data in your organization as download files. The response contains URLs to download all the data from Azure Storage. This API enables you to download all your data from Azure Storage as follows: <ol><li>Call the API to get a list of download URLs with all your organization data.</li><li>Download all the files using the download URLs and process the data as you like.</li></ol>
**Delta export** software vulnerabilities assessment **(JSON response)**|Investigation collection See: [3.4 Properties Delta export (JSON response)](#34-properties-delta-export-json-response)|Returns a table with an entry for every unique combination of: DeviceId, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId, and EventTimestamp. <p> The API pulls data in your organization as JSON responses. The response is paginated, so you can use the @odata.nextLink field from the response to fetch the next results. The full software vulnerabilities assessment (JSON response) is used to obtain an entire snapshot of the software vulnerabilities assessment of your organization by device. However, the delta export API call is used to fetch only the changes that have happened between a selected date and the current date (the "delta" API call). Instead of getting a full export with a large amount of data every time, you'll only get specific information on new, fixed, and updated vulnerabilities. Delta export API call can also be used to calculate different KPIs such as "how many vulnerabilities were fixed?" or "how many new vulnerabilities were added to my organization?" <p> Because the Delta export API call for software vulnerabilities returns data for only a targeted date range, it isn't considered a _full export_.
