### Versioning

> The API supports versioning.
>
> The current version is **V1.0**.
>
> To use a specific version, use this format: `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/{Version}`. For example: `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/v1.0/alerts`
>
> If you don't specify any version (e.g. `https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts`) you will get to the latest version.
