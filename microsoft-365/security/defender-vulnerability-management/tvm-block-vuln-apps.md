# Block vulnerable applications

Along with taking the remediation steps suggested by a security recommendation, security admins may decide to block all currently known vulnerable versions of an application.  

This is an immediate action that security admins can take and is meant to temporarily reduce risk until the remediation request is completed. Remediating vulnerabilities takes time and can be dependent on the IT team, who have other responsibilities and limited resources. The block option gives IT teams time to patch the application without security admins worrying that the vulnerabilities will be exploited in the meantime.

Security admins with the proper permissions can perform a mitigation action and block vulnerable versions of an application from the Recommendations page. File indicators of compromise (IOC)s are created for each of the executable files that belong to vulnerable versions of that application. Microsoft Defender Antivirus then enforces blocks on the devices that are in the specified scope.  

This feature is only available through the **Microsoft 365 security** portal at security.microsoft.com.  

## Blocking an application vs warning users  

The **block action** is intended to block all installed vulnerable versions of the application in your organization from running. For example, if there is an active zero-day vulnerability you can block your users from running the affected software while you determine work-around options.   

The **warn action** is intended to send a warning to your users when they open vulnerable versions of the application. Users will have the option to bypass the warning and access the application.

For both actions, you can customize the message the users will see. For example, you can encourage them to install the latest version.  


**NOTE:** The block and warn actions are typically enforced within a couple of minutes, but can take up to 1 hour.  

Further action will be required if new versions become vulnerable, or additional vulnerable versions are introduced into the organization. For example, you blocked known vulnerable versions of the Contoso app on April 3<sup>rd</sup>. But then, on April 15<sup>th</sup> a vulnerability is found on a different version of the Contoso app installed in your organization. A new security recommendation will appear telling you to update the app, and you can choose to block this different version that now has a vulnerability.

## Minimum requirements  

This feature is available at Microsoft 365 security (security.microsoft.com) and only if your organization has the following turned on:  

- **Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active mode)**: The detection of file execution events and blocking requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be enabled in active mode. By design, passive mode and EDR in block mode cannot detect and block based on file execution. [Learn about deploying Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/deploy-manage-report-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)  
- **Cloud–delivered protection (enabled)**: For more information, see [Manage cloud–based protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide).  
- **Allow or block file (on)**: Go to Settings &gt; Advanced features &gt; Allow or block file. [Learn more about advanced features](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/advanced-features?view=o365-worldwide)  

## Version requirements  

- The Antimalware client version must be 4.18.1901.x or later.
- The Engine version must be 1.1.16200.x or later.  
- Supported on Windows 10 devices, version 1809 or later, with the latest windows updates installed.  

## Permissions  

-   If you use [<u>role-based access control</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/rbac?view=o365-worldwide), then you need to assigned a role that has the **Threat and vulnerability management - Application handling** permission  

-   If you have not turned on RBAC, you must have been assigned one of the following Azure AD roles: **security admin** or **global admin**. [<u>Learn more about basic permissions</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/basic-permissions?view=o365-worldwide)

How to block vulnerable applications  

1.  Go to the **Vulnerability management** navigation menu in the Microsoft 365 security portal, and select [**<u>Recommendations</u>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-security-recommendation?view=o365-worldwide).  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image1.png" style="width:2.72917in;height:2.42708in" alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />  

1.  Select a security recommendation you would like to request remediation for, and then select [**<u>Request remediation</u>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-remediation?view=o365-worldwide).  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image2.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:6.92431in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />  

1.  If you have device groups, choose whether you want to apply the remediation and mitigation to all device groups or only a few.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image3.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:4.80903in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />  

1.  Fill out the **Remediation request** so the IT team knows what to work on. The remediation options are software update, software uninstall, and attention required. Don’t forget to select a due date.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image4.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:5.33542in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />  

1.  Under **Mitigation action**, select **Block** or **Warn**. Once you submit a mitigation action, it will be immediately applied.  

 <img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image5.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:4.04167in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />  

1.  Review the selections you made, and **Submit request**.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image6.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:7.02639in" alt="Text Description automatically generated" />  

1.  After you have submitted the request, go to the [**<u>Remediation</u>**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-remediation?view=o365-worldwide) page to view the status of your remediation request and blocked applications. If circumstances change, you can also unblock applications from there.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image7.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:1.41597in" alt="A picture containing graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image8.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:1.38681in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />  

File blocks are typically enforced within a couple of minutes, but can take up to 1 hour to fully propagate.  

 

**Important**  

Based on the available data, the block action will take effect on endpoints in the organization that have Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will make a best attempt effort of blocking the applicable vulnerable application or version from running.  

 

When blocking is not supported  

If you don't see the mitigation option, it's because the ability to block the application is currently not supported. Recommendations that don't include mitigation actions include:  

-   Microsoft apps  

-   Recommendations related to operating systems  

-   Recommendations related to apps for MacOS and Linux  

<!-- -->

-   Apps where Microsoft does not have sufficient information or a high confidence to block  

>  

Possible errors you may encounter when trying to block  

If you try to block an application and it doesn't work, there are a few reasons why this occurred:  

-   Remediation and mitigation activities could not be created due to the security information available to Microsoft.  

<!-- -->

-   You have reached the maximum indicator capacity. If this is the case, you can delete old indicators [<u>Learn more about indicators</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-indicators?view=o365-worldwide)  

Additional actions you can take  

-   **View the file hashes and response actions**: Go to Settings &gt; [<u>Indicators</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/indicator-manage?view=o365-worldwide).  

-   Note: If you use the [<u>Indicators API</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/get-ti-indicators-collection?view=o365-worldwide) with programmatic indicator queries as part of your workflows, be aware that the block action will give additional results.  

-   **Threat history**: View the threat history for each device by going to the Windows Security app &gt; Virus & threat protection &gt; Protection history. You won't be able to see the threat history for Windows version 1809 or earlier.  

>  

  

View blocked remediation activities  

After you block an application as a mitigation action from the Security recommendations page, a remediation activity is created in **Remediation** &gt; **Remediation activities**. This is an activity log, and not the current block status of the application. Filter by Mitigation type: Block and/or Warn to view all activities pertaining to block or warn actions.  

Once you find the relevant activity, select it to view the remediation description, mitigation description, link to the blocked application, device groups, and other relevant info.  

 

View blocked applications  

Find the list of blocked applications by going to **Remediation** &gt; **Blocked applications** tab.  

From there, you view the software name, the vendor, status, blocked versions, and how long it's been blocked.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image8.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:1.38681in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />  

Select a blocked application to view a flyout with details about the number of vulnerabilities, whether exploits are available, blocked versions, and remediation actions.  

-   The "Blocked by" section lists the first person who blocked the application, and the "Blocked since" date is the first time it was blocked.  

  

You can also **Unblock software** or **Open software page**.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image9.png" style="width:5.97917in;height:8.875in" alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />  

How to unblock applications  

Select a blocked application to view the option to **Unblock software** in the flyout.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image10.png" style="width:3.48958in;height:1.10417in" alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated with low confidence" />  

After you have unblocked an application, refresh the page to see it removed from the list. It can take up to 1 hour for an application to be unblocked. Your users will now be able to access the application.  

**Learn more about how to** [<u>Create indicators for files \| Microsoft Docs</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/indicator-file?view=o365-worldwide), including the prerequisites and technical specifications.  

  

End-user experience  

When you block an application, users trying to access it will  be directed to: 

-    [<u>https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationBlockSupport</u>](https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationBlockSupport), for applications blocked by your organization   

-   [<u>https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationWarnSupport</u>](https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationWarnSupport) for applications blocked by your organization with the option to bypass the block 

  

Users will receive the following notifications:  

**Block end-user notification** 

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image11.png" style="width:4.5in;height:3.20833in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" /> 

 

**Warn (block with bypass) end-user notification** 

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image12.png" style="width:4.625in;height:3.04167in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" /> 

 

The user has the option to bypass the block for the subsequent launches, by choosing “Allow”. 

This allow is only temporary, and the application will be blocked again after a while. 

 

**Block end-user notification with custom message**  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image13.png" style="width:4.625in;height:2.82292in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />  

 

End-user updating blocked applications  

A commonly asked question is how does an end-user update a blocked application? The block is enforced by blocking the executable file. Some applications, such as firefox, rely on a separate update executable which will not be blocked by this feature.  In other cases when the application requires the main executable file to update, it is recommended to either implement the block in warn mode (so that the end-user can bypass the block) or the end-user can delete the application (if no vital information is stored on the client) and reinstall the application.
