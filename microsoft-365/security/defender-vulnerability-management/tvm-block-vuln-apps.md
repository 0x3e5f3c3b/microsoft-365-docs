# Block vulnerable applications

Remediating vulnerabilities takes time and can be dependent on the responsibilities and resources of the IT team. Security admins can temporarily reduce the risk of a vulnerability by taking the immediate action to block all currently known vulnerable versions of an application, until the remediation request is completed. The block option gives IT teams time to patch the application without security admins worrying that the vulnerabilities will be exploited in the meantime.

While taking the remediation steps suggested by a security recommendation, security admins with the proper permissions can perform a mitigation action and block vulnerable versions of an application. File indicators of compromise (IOC)s will be created for each of the executable files that belong to vulnerable versions of that application. Microsoft Defender Antivirus then enforces blocks on the devices that are in the specified scope.  

## Blocking an application vs warning users  

The **block action** is intended to block all installed vulnerable versions of the application in your organization from running. For example, if there is an active zero-day vulnerability you can block your users from running the affected software while you determine work-around options.

The **warn action** is intended to send a warning to your users when they open vulnerable versions of the application. Users will have the option to bypass the warning and access the application.

For both actions, you can customize the message the users will see. For example, you can encourage them to install the latest version.  

> [!Note]
> The block and warn actions are typically enforced within a couple of minutes, but can take up to 1 hour.  

## Minimum requirements  

- **Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active mode)**: The detection of file execution events and blocking requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be enabled in active mode. By design, passive mode and EDR in block mode cannot detect and block based on file execution. [Learn about deploying Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/deploy-manage-report-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)  
- **Cloud–delivered protection (enabled)**: For more information, see [Manage cloud–based protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide).  
- **Allow or block file (on)**: Go to Settings &gt; Advanced features &gt; Allow or block file. [Learn more about advanced features](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/advanced-features?view=o365-worldwide)  

## Version requirements  

- The Antimalware client version must be 4.18.1901.x or later.
- The Engine version must be 1.1.16200.x or later.  
- Supported on Windows 10 devices, version 1809 or later, with the latest windows updates installed.  

## Permissions  

- If you use[Role-based access control (RBAC)](/security/defender-endpoint/rbac.md), then you need to assigned a role that has the **Threat and vulnerability management - Application handling** permission  
- If you have not turned on RBAC, you must have been assigned one of the following Azure AD roles: **security admin** or **global admin**. [Learn more about basic permissions](/security/defender-endpoint/basic-permissions)  

## How to block vulnerable applications  

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), in the navigation pane, go to, **Vulnerability management** > **Recommendations**.
2. Select a security recommendation to see a flyout with more information.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Security recommendation details" source="../../media/defender-mdvm/request-remediation.png" lightbox="../../media/defender-mdvm//request-remediation.png":::

3. Select **Request remediation**
4. Select whether you want to apply the remediation and mitigation to all device groups or only a few.
5. Select the remediation options on the **Remediation request** page. The remediation options are software update, software uninstall, and attention required.
6. Pick a **Remediation due date** and select **Next**.
7. Under **Mitigation action**, select **Block** or **Warn**. Once you submit a mitigation action, it will be immediately applied.  

:::image type="content" alt-text="Mitigation action" source="../../media/defender-mdvm/mitigation-action.png" lightbox="../../media/defender-mdvm//mitigation-action.png":::

8. Review the selections you made, and **Submit request**.  

On the final **remediation-activities-created** you can choose to view you blocked applications: 

:::image type="content" alt-text="view blocked application" source="../../media/defender-mdvm/remediation-activities-created.png" lightbox="../../media/defender-mdvm/remediation-activities-created.png":::

After you have submitted the request, go to **Vulnerability management** > **Remediation** to view the status of your remediation request and blocked applications.

> [!Important]
> Based on the available data, the block action will take effect on endpoints in the organization that have Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will make a best attempt effort of blocking the applicable vulnerable application or version from running.  

If additional vulnerabilities are found on a different version of an application, you'll get a new security recommendation, asking you to update the application, and you can choose to also block this different version.

## When blocking is not supported

If you don't see the mitigation option, it's because the ability to block the application is currently not supported. Recommendations that don't include mitigation actions include:  

- Microsoft applications
- Recommendations related to operating systems  
- Recommendations related to apps for MacOS and Linux  
- Apps where Microsoft does not have sufficient information or a high confidence to block  

If you try to block an application and it doesn't work, you may have reached the maximum indicator capacity. If this is the case, you can delete old indicators [Learn more about indicators](/security/defender-endpoint/manage-indicators.md)  
  
## View blocked remediation activities  

After you block an application as a mitigation action from a security recommendation, a remediation activity is created in **Remediation** **Remediation activities**. This is an activity log, and not the current block status of the application. 

Filter by Mitigation type: Block and/or Warn to view all activities pertaining to block or warn actions.  

Once you find the relevant activity, select it to view the remediation description, mitigation description, link to the blocked application, device groups, and other relevant info.  

## View blocked applications  

Find the list of blocked applications by going to **Remediation** > **Blocked applications** tab.  

From there, you view the software name, the vendor, status, blocked versions, and how long it's been blocked.

Select a blocked application to view a flyout with details about the number of vulnerabilities, whether exploits are available, blocked versions, and remediation actions.  

-   The "Blocked by" section lists the first person who blocked the application, and the "Blocked since" date is the first time it was blocked.  

  

You can also **Unblock software** or **Open software page**.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image9.png" style="width:5.97917in;height:8.875in" alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />  

How to unblock applications  

Select a blocked application to view the option to **Unblock software** in the flyout.  

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image10.png" style="width:3.48958in;height:1.10417in" alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated with low confidence" />  

After you have unblocked an application, refresh the page to see it removed from the list. It can take up to 1 hour for an application to be unblocked. Your users will now be able to access the application.  

**Learn more about how to** [<u>Create indicators for files \| Microsoft Docs</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/indicator-file?view=o365-worldwide), including the prerequisites and technical specifications.  

  

End-user experience  

When you block an application, users trying to access it will  be directed to: 

-    [<u>https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationBlockSupport</u>](https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationBlockSupport), for applications blocked by your organization   

-   [<u>https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationWarnSupport</u>](https://aka.ms/TvmApplicationWarnSupport) for applications blocked by your organization with the option to bypass the block 

  

Users will receive the following notifications:  

**Block end-user notification** 

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image11.png" style="width:4.5in;height:3.20833in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" /> 

 

**Warn (block with bypass) end-user notification** 

<img src="C:\GitHub\microsoft-365-docs-pr\microsoft-365\security\defender-vulnerability-management\media\image12.png" style="width:4.625in;height:3.04167in" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" /> 

 

The user has the option to bypass the block for the subsequent launches, by choosing “Allow”. 

This allow is only temporary, and the application will be blocked again after a while. 

 

**Block end-user notification with custom message**

End-user updating blocked applications  

A commonly asked question is how does an end-user update a blocked application? The block is enforced by blocking the executable file. Some applications, such as firefox, rely on a separate update executable which will not be blocked by this feature.  In other cases when the application requires the main executable file to update, it is recommended to either implement the block in warn mode (so that the end-user can bypass the block) or the end-user can delete the application (if no vital information is stored on the client) and reinstall the application.
