**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Firmware and hardware attacks are on the rise. Attackers are increasingly targeting firmware and device drivers of hardware components to gain high privilege and persistence. Visibility into the threat posture of firmware and timely remediation of firmware vulnerabilities are paramount for enterprise security.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management hardware and firmware assessment provides a list of known hardware and firmware in your organization. It provides individual inventories for system models, processors, and BIOS. Each view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.

Access to information your organization’s exposure to firmware vulnerabilities, along with recommended measures and remediation instructions you can take means you can start to effectively protect your organization from hardware and firmware risks.
>
>[!Note]
> Vulnerability assessment is available for processor and BIOS weaknesses for HP, Dell, and Lenovo. Weaknesses for other vendors are not reported.
>
> Inventory and weaknesses data is collected on Windows, Linux, and MacOS (refer to the [list of supported platforms](tvm-supported-os.md).
>
> **Note**: processor and BIOS information is not reported on Mac devices with M1 processor.


## Get started: Navigate to the Hardware & Firmware page

## Advanced Hunting

You can use advanced hunting queries to gain visibility on hardware and firmware in your organization. Find details about the hardware and firmware installed per device in the **DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware** table. This table contains hardware and firmware information per device, including system model, processor, and BIOS. 

See a description of the table columns below.

Here are some sample queries to hunt for using this table:

Count the number of Lenovo devices

**DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware**

**\| where ComponentType == "Hardware" and Manufacturer == "lenovo"**

**\| summarize count()**

Find all devices with specific vulnerable BIOS version

**DeviceTvmHardwareFirmware**

**\| where ComponentType == "Bios" and ComponentVersion contains "N2VET29W"**

**\|project DeviceId, DeviceName**

## UEFI Secure Boot mode setting

To find devices that require enabling of UEFI Secure Boot mode use the following query.

**DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment**

**\| where ConfigurationId == "scid-2100"**

**\| project DeviceId, DeviceName**

## Hardware and Firmware API

You can use APIs to view all hardware and firmware installed in your organization, including component type, vendor, and version.
