# Hardware and firmware assessment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

Firmware and hardware attacks are on the rise. Attackers are increasingly targeting firmware and device drivers of hardware components to gain high privilege and persistence. Visibility into the threat posture of your firmware and hardware, and timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities are paramount for enterprise security.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management hardware and firmware assessment provides a list of known hardware and firmware in your organization. It provides individual inventories for system models, processors, and BIOS. Each view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.

>[!Note]
> Vulnerability assessment is available for processor and BIOS weaknesses for HP, Dell, and Lenovo. Weaknesses for other vendors are not reported.
>
> Inventory and weaknesses data is collected on Windows, Linux, and MacOS (refer to the [list of supported platforms](tvm-supported-os.md).
>
> **Note**: processor and BIOS information is not reported on Mac devices with M1 processor.

## Get started: Navigate to the Hardware & Firmware page  

To access the new hardware and firmware assessment page:

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** \> **Inventories** in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Hardware and Firmware** tab.

The **Hardware and Firmware** page opens with individual pages available for:

- [Laptops, desktop, and server modals](#laptops-desktop-and-server-modals)
- [Processors](#processors)
- [BIOS inventory](#bios-inventory)

## Laptops, desktop, and server modals

Select the **Laptops, desktop, and server modals** page to see a list of all system models in the organization. Weaknesses and exposed devices information is based on security advisories from HP, Dell, and Lenovo and relates to processors and BIOS only. Weaknesses for other OEM vendors are not reported.
