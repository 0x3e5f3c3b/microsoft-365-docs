The ability to share files and folders over a network allows users to provide access to resources like files, documents, and media to other people on the network. As network shares can be easily accessed by network users, some common weaknesses exist that can cause network shares to be vulnerable.

When vulnerable network share configurations are identified, they're mapped to actionable security recommendations in the Security recommendations page. The following recommendations can help protect against vulnerabilities in network shares that could be exploited by attackers:

- Disallow offline access to shares
- Remove shares from the root folder
- Remove share write permission set to ‘Everyone’
- Set folder enumeration for shares

## Find information about exposed network shares

To see security recommendations addressing network share configurations:

1. **Vulnerability management** > **Recommendations**.
2. Select **Filters** and choose **Related component** > **OS Shares**

4. Select **Apply**

If there are network shares with vulnerabilities to address, they'll appear in the list of recommendations
