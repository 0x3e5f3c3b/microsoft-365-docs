# Security baselines overview

Instead of running never-ending compliance scans, security baselines in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), helps you to continuously and effortlessly monitor your organization's security baselines compliance and identify changes in real time.

A security baseline profile is a customized profile that you can create to assess and monitors endpoints in your organization against industry security benchmarks. When you create a security baseline profile, you're creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration settings and a base benchmark to compare against.

Security baselines provides support for Center for Internet Security (**CIS)** benchmarks for Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and above, as well as Security Technical Implementation Guides (**STIG)** benchmarks for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

## Get started with security baselines

1. In the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), in the navigation pane, go to, **Configuration and baselines** > **Security baselines**
2. Select the **Profiles** tab at the top, then select the **Create profile** button
3. Enter a name and description for your security baselines profile
4. Immediately activate this profile **Activate profile** enabled
5. Select **Next** to go to the baseline profile scope page
6. Set the profile settings such as Operating system, Base benchmark (CIS or STIG), and the Compliance level

7. Assign the configurations and settings you want to include in the profile

8. Select **Next** to go to the review profile page
9. Review the profile and select **Submit** to create your profile

> [!Note]
> You can create multiple profiles for the same operating system with various customizations.

## Review security baseline profile assessment results

1. In the **Profiles** page select any of your profiles to open a flyout with additional information

2. Click on **Open profile page**

The profile page contains two tabs **Configurations** and **Devices**.

In the **Configurations** tab, you can review the list of configurations and assess the accuracy of their reported compliance state.

By selecting a configuration in the list, you’ll see a flyout with details for the policy setting, including the recommended value (the expected value range for a device to be considered compliant) and the source used to determine the current device settings.

The **Devices** tab shows a list of all applicable devices and their compliance state against this specific configuration. For each device, you can use the current value detected to see why it is compliant or non compliant

### View by device

On the main profiles page, select the **Device** tab to view a list of devices and assess the accuracy of their reported compliance state.

By selecting a device in the list, you’ll see a flyout with additional details.  

Select the **Configurations** tab to view the compliance of this specific device against all the profile configurations.

For each device, you can see the list of configurations it has and check the compliance status.  

At the top of the device side panel, select **Open device page** to go to the device page in the device inventory. The device page displays the **Baseline compliance** tab that provides granular visibility into the compliance of the device.

By selecting a configuration in the list, you’ll see a flyout with compliance details for the policy setting on this device:

## Use advanced hunting

The following tables in advanced hunting contain security baselines assessment information:  

- DeviceBaselineComplianceProfiles: Created profiles and details
- DeviceBaselineComplianceAssessment: Devices and the settings per device  
- DeviceBaselineComplianceAssessmentKB: general settings for CIS and STIG benchmarks (not related to any device)
