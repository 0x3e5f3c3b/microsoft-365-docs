Software usage information is critical when it comes to evaluating software vulnerabilities in your organization. When vulnerable applications are widely and frequently used, it poses a security risk.

Defender vulnerability management software usage information gives you insights into the total number of devices using an application and the median usage (in days) for that application over the past 30 days.

These insights can help organizations understand the potential impact of blocking vulnerable applications.

## Minimum requirements

**Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active or passive mode)**:
The detection of file execution events requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be enabled in active or passive mode. To learn more, see

## View software usage information

Daily software usage is calculated from process events collected by the core endpoint detection and response service for all onboarded devices. Software usage information can be viewed through the following experiences in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

### Software inventory view

You can view software usage by selecting an application in the Software inventory page. A flyout panel will open with more details including data related to that software’s usage over the past 30 days.

You can also view **Software usage (days)** in the **Version distribution** tab in the software page, and **Software usage insights** when reviewing security recommendations.

## **When usage insights are not supported**

If you don’t see usage insights, it's because that application is currently not supported. Software usage is currently not supported for:

- Software usage related to operating systems
- Software usage related to apps for macOS and Linux
- Software usage for apps where Microsoft does not have sufficient information about the application
