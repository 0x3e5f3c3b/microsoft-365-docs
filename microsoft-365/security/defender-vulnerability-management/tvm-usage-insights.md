Software usage information is critical when it comes to evaluating software vulnerabilities in your organization. When vulnerable applications are widely and frequently used, it poses a security risk to the organization.

Defender Vulnerability Management Software usage information gives you insights about the total number of devices using an application in your organization. You can also gain insights into the median usage (in days) for that application over the past 30 days.

Usage insights can help your organization when making decisions to block vulnerable applications in your organization.

## Minimum requirements

**Microsoft Defender Antivirus (active or passive mode)**: The detection of file execution events requires Microsoft Defender Antivirus to be enabled in active or passive mode. To learn more, see

## View overall usage for an application

Software usage helps inform organizations of the user impact if they want to block software or any vulnerable versions. Daily software usage is calculated from process events collected by the core endpoint detection and response service and shown for any number of onboarded devices.

### Software inventory view

Admins can view software usage by selecting an application in the Software inventory page, which then opens a detail pane where they can view data related to that software’s usage over the past 30 days.

You can also view days used in the “Version distribution” tab in the software page, and software usage insights when reviewing security recommendations.

## **When usage insights are not supported**

If you don’t see usage insights for an application, it is because that application is currently not supported. Software usage is currently not supported for:

- Software usage related to operating systems
- Software usage related to apps for macOS and Linux
- Software usage for apps where Microsoft does not have sufficient information about the application
