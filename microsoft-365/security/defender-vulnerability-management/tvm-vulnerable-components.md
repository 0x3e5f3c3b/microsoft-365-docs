**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229011)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)

- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).
 
Software components, such as libraries and JAR files, are increasing becoming targets of threat campaigns and attacks and zero days.

Vulnerable components in Defender Vulnerability Management lists components, known have had vulnerabilities, that Defender Vulnerability supports. This support means that Defender Vulnerability Management will be able to identify, report on, and provide recommendations for any future vulnerabilities in these components. The view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.
