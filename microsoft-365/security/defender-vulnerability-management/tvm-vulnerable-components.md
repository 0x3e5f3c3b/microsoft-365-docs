# Vulnerable components

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229011)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).
 
Software components, such as libraries and JAR files, are increasing becoming targets of threat campaigns and attacks and zero days.

Vulnerable components in Defender Vulnerability Management lists components, known have had vulnerabilities, that Defender Vulnerability supports. This support means that Defender Vulnerability Management will be able to identify, report on, and provide recommendations for any future vulnerabilities in these components. The view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.

## Navigate to the vulnerable components page

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** \> **Inventories** in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Vulnerable components** tab.

The **Vulnerable components** page opens with a list of known vulnerable components identified in your organization. It provides information including the component name and vendor, the number of weaknesses found for that component, and if there are active threats or alerts associated with it.

> **vlog4j, openssl, commons_text, spring_framework, litedb, libwebp**

### Component details

Select a vulnerable component to open a flyout pane where you find more information about the vulnerable component.

Select the **Installed devices** tab to the devices the component is installed on.

You can select the **Vulnerable files** tab to see information on the vulnerable file paths and versions, the related vulnerabilities, along with the exposed devices.

From the flyout pane, you can also dive deeper into the vulnerable component by selecting **Open component page**, or flag any technical inconsistencies by selecting **Report inaccuracy**. For more information, see [Report inaccuracy](./tvm-software-inventory#report-inaccuracy).

## Vulnerable components page

When you select **Open component page** for a vulnerable component, you'll see a full page with all the details of a specific vulnerable component:

### View recommendations

o	The 'Security recommendation' for 'vulnerable components' is different than the standard security recommendation for software applications, since there's no straightforward mitigation via updating/patching the vulnerable component. Therefore, the recommendation is of type 'Attention required', which is similar to Zero-day. 
A new 'Vulnerable files' tab is added (Installed device tab is not shown).
No 

See recommendations where we detected a vulnerable component in your organization.

Select a software name to open the flyout, and look for the section called "Software Evidence."

### Vulnerable components APIs

You can use APIs to view information on the vulnerable components in your organization. The information returned by the APIs includes: devices it's installed on, software name, software vendor, installed versions, and number of weaknesses. For more information, see:
