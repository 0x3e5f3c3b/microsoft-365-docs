# Vulnerable components

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229011)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).

It is becoming increasingly difficult for security administrators to identify and mitigate the security and compliance risks associated with common, proprietary and open-source software components and dependencies used in their organizations. This lack of visibility makes it hard for security administrators to determine whether their organization is exposed to existing or newly emerging security threats caused by vulnerabilities in these software components.

To help address this challenge, for components known to have had critical vulnerabilities in the past, the vulnerable components capability in Defender Vulnerability Management provides support to identify, report on, and provide recommendations for any future vulnerabilities identified in these components.

With visibility into the existence of these vulnerable components on a device, security administrators can invest their attention and resources on feasible risk reduction steps.

> Did you know you can try all the features in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management for free? Find out how to [sign up for a free trial](../defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management-trial.md).

## Navigate to the vulnerable components page

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** \> **Inventories** in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Vulnerable components** tab.

The **Vulnerable components** page opens with a list of known vulnerable components identified in your organization. It provides information including the component name and vendor, the number of weaknesses found for that component, and if there are active threats or alerts associated with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Support is currently only available for the following vulnerable components:
>
> - vlog4j
> - openssl
> - commons_text
> - spring_framework
> - litedb
> - libwebp

### Component details

Select a vulnerable component to open a flyout pane where you'll find more information about that vulnerable component.

Select the **Installed devices** tab to see a list of devices the component is installed on.

You can select the **Vulnerable files** tab to see information on the vulnerable file paths and versions, the related vulnerabilities, and the exposed devices.

From the flyout pane, you can also dive deeper into the vulnerable component by selecting **Open component page**, see [Vulnerable components page](#vulnerable-components-page), or flag any technical inconsistencies by selecting **Report inaccuracy**, see [Report inaccuracy](./tvm-software-inventory.md#report-inaccuracy).

## Vulnerable components page

Select **Open component page** for a vulnerable component, to get a full page with all the details of a specific vulnerable component:

The page includes information on the component vendor, the devices the component is installed on and data visualizations showing the number of discovered vulnerabilities and exposed devices.

Tabs are available showing information specific to the vulnerable component, such as:

- Corresponding security recommendations for the vulnerabilities identified
- Vulnerable files tab with information on the vulnerable file paths and versions, the related vulnerabilities, along with the exposed devices.

### View recommendations

To view the security recommendations for vulnerable components:

1. Go to **Vulnerability management** \> **Inventories** and select the **Vulnerable components** tab.
2. Select a vulnerable component and select **Go to related security recommendation** in the flyout pane.

This will bring you to a page with a list of the related security recommendations. When you select the security recommendation you will see in the flyout pane that the security recommendation is of type **Attention required**. This is because there's no straightforward mitigation to update or patch the vulnerable component. As components can be used throughout an organization having the type 'Attention required' means administrators can use the information available for the vulnerable component to assess the impact of any suggested remediation across the organization.

Security recommendations for a vulnerable component can also be viewed from the component page.

### Vulnerable components on devices

You can also view a list of vulnerable components on a device. With a device page open, select **Inventories** and then **Vulnerable** to see a list of vulnerable components installed on that device.

### Vulnerable components APIs

You can use APIs to view information on the vulnerable components in your organization. The information returned by the APIs includes: devices it's installed on, software name, software vendor, installed versions, and number of weaknesses. For more information, see:
