# Vulnerable components

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229011)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan).
 
Software components, such as libraries and JAR files, are increasing becoming targets of threat campaigns and attacks and zero days.


Vulnerable components in Defender Vulnerability Management lists components, known have had vulnerabilities, that Defender Vulnerability supports. This support means that Defender Vulnerability Management will be able to identify, report on, and provide recommendations for any future vulnerabilities in these components. The view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.

## Vulnerable components overview

The **Vulnerable components** page opens with a list of vulnerable components identified in your organization, including the component name, weaknesses found, threats associated with them, exposed devices, impact to exposure score, and tags.

By default, the view is filtered by **Product Code (CPE): Available**. You can also filter the list view based on weaknesses found in the software, threats associated with them, and tags like whether the software has reached end-of-support.

Select the vulnerable component you want to investigate. A flyout panel will open with a more compact view of the information on the page. You can either dive deeper into the investigation and select **Open software page**, or flag any technical inconsistencies by selecting **Report inaccuracy**.

## Navigate to the vulnerable components page

Access the software inventory page by selecting **Software inventory** from the Vulnerability management navigation menu in the [Microsoft Defender portal](../defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mde.md).

### Supported vulnerable components

The following list indicates that vulnerable components currently supported:

- 

Support will be expanded in teh future.

## Software inventory on devices

From the Microsoft Defender portal navigation panel, go to the **[Device inventory](../defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview.md)**. Select the name of a device to open the device page (like Computer1), then select the **Software inventory** tab to see a list of all the known software present on the device. Select a specific software entry to open the flyout with more information.

Software may be visible at the device level even if it's currently not supported by vulnerability management. However, only limited data will be available. You'll know if software is unsupported because it will say "Not available" in the "Weakness" column.

Software with no CPE can also show up under this device-specific software inventory.

### View recommendations

See recommendations where we detected a vulnerable component in your organization. 

Select a software name to open the flyout, and look for the section called "Software Evidence."
