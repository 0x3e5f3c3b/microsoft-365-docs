# Windows authenticated scan


[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2154037)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](index.yml)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

>[!Note]
>Want to experience Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management? Learn more about how you can sign up to the [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management public preview trial](../defender-vulnerability-management/get-defender-vulnerability-management.md).

Windows authenticated scan provides the ability to remotely target by IP ranges and scan Windows services by providing Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management with credentials to remotely access the machines.

This is applicable for devices that do not have the Defender Vulnerability Management or Defender for Endpoint agent deployed.

## Scanner Installation

Similar to [network device](../defender-endpoint/network-devices.md) authenticated scan, you'll need a scanning device with the scanner installed. If you don’t already have the network scanner installed, see [Install the network scanner](../defender-endpoint/network-devices.md#install-the-network-scanner) for steps on how to download and install the network scanner.

>[!NOTE]
> No changes are required for pre-existing scanners installed.

## Pre-requisites

The following section lists the pre-requisites you need to configure to use Windows authenticated scan.

**Scanning account**

A scanning account is required to remotely access the devices. This must be a [Group Managed Service Account (gMsa)](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview/). To create a gMsa account:

1. On your domain controller in a PowerShell window, run: *New-ADServiceAccount -name gmsa1 -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword scanner-win11-i$ -KerberosEncryptionType RC4, AES128, AES256 –verbose*
    - gmsa1 stands for the name of the account you are creating, and scanner-win11-I$ stands for the machine name where the scanner agent will run. Only this machine will be able to retrieve the account password. You can provide a comma separated list of machines
    - Modifying an existing account can be done with *Get-ADServiceAccount and Set-ADServiceAccount*

On the machine where the scanner agent will run, using an elevated PowerShell window, run: *Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity gmsa1* to test the account.

If your PowerShell doesn’t recognize those commands, it probably means you are missing a required PowerShell module. Instructions on how to install the module vary depending on your OS. For more information, see [Powershell reference documentation](learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps/).


**Devices to be scanned**

Use the table below for guidance on the what you need to have configured on devices that will be scanned.

| Devices to be scanned requirements | Description |
|:---|:---|
|Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Registry is enabled| To enable remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): </br> </br> - Verify the Windows Management Instrumentation service is running. </br> </br> - Go to **Control Panel** &gt; **All Control Panel Items** &gt; **Windows Defender Firewall** &gt; **Allowed applications** and ensure Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is allowed through Windows Firewall.|
|Scanning account is a member of **Performance Monitor Users** group| The scanning account must be a member of **Performance Monitor Users** group|
|**Performance Monitor Users** group has **Enable Account** and **Remote Enable** permissions on Root/CIMV2 WMI namespace | To verify or enable these permissions: </br> </br> - Run wmimgmt.msc </br> - Right click **WMI Control (Local)** and select **Properties**</br> - Go to the Security tab</br> - Select the relevant WMI namespace and select **Security**</br> - Add the specified group and allow the specific permissions</br> - Select **Advanced**, select the specified group, and click **edit**</br> - Set **Applies To** to “This namespace and subnamespaces”|
|**Performance Monitor Users** group should have permissions on DCOM operations| To verify or enable these permissions: </br> - Run dcomcnfg </br> - Navigate to **Component Services** > **Computers** > **My Computer** </br> - Right click My Computer and choose **Properties** </br> - Go to the COM Security tab </br> - Go to **Access Permissions** > **Edit Limits**, add the specified group, and select to allow **Remote Access** </br> - Go to **Launch and Activation Permissions** > **Edit Limits** > add the specified group and select to allow **Remote Launch** and **Remote Activation** |
| **Performance Monitor Users** group has permissions to perform WMI operations via DCOM protocol| To verify or enable these permissions: </br> - Run dcomcnfg </br> - Navigate to **Component Services** > **Computers** > **My Computer** > **DCOM config** </br> - Right click **Windows Management and Instrumentation** and choose **Properties** </br> - Go to the Security tab </br> -Go to Edit **Launch and Activation Permissions** </br> - Add the specified group and select to allow **Remote Launch** and **Remote Activation** </br>

## Configure a new authenticated scan

To configure a new authenticated scan, go to:

1. **Settings** > **Device discovery** > **Authenticated scans**
2. Select **Add new scan** and choose **Windows authenticated scan**:

     :::image type="content" source="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/authenticated-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add new authenticated scan screen" lightbox="../../media/defender-vulnerability-management/authenticated-scan.png":::

3. Enter an **Scan name**
4. Select the **Scanning device:** The onboarded device you'll use to scan the unmanaged devices
5. Enter the **Target (range):** The IP addresses\range you want to scan
6. Select the **Scan interval:** By default, the scan will run every hour, you can change the scan interval or have it only run once, by selecting ‘Do not repeat’
7. Choose your **Authentication method** - there are two options to choose from:  
    - Kerberos (preferred)
    - Negotiate (Negotiate option will fallback to NTLM in case Kerberos fails. Using NTLM is not recommended as it is not a secure protocol)
8. Enter the credentials Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management will use to remotely access the devices:
    - **Use azure key vault:** If you manage your credentials in Azure Key Vault you can enter the Key Vault URL and Secret Name to be accessed by the scanner device to provide credentials
    - **Enter [gMSA credentials](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview/):** Input the Domain (optional) and Username
9. Select **Next** to run or skip the test scan
10. Select **Next** to review the settings and the select **Submit** to create your new authenticated scan.

### Windows authenticated scan APIs

You can use APIs to create a new scan and view all existing configured scans in your organization. For more information, see:
