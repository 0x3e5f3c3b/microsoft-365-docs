# Link query results to an incident

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The link to incident feature lets you select advanced hunting query results to add to a new or existing incident under investigation. This feature helps you easily capture records from advanced hunting activities so you can create a richer timeline or context of events regarding an incident. 

## Link results to new or existing incidents

1. In the advanced hunting query page, first enter your query in the query field provided then select Run query to get your results.

2. In the Results page, select the events or records that are related to a new or current investigation you are working on, then select Link to incident.
