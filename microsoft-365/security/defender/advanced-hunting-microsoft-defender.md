# Advanced hunting in the Microsoft Defender portal


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender 


Microsoft Defender, a single portal bringing together Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR, provides more comprehensive features, including AI, automation, guided experiences, and curated threat intelligence, to help security teams protect against, detect, investigate, and respond to threats across every security domain.

By unifying experiences, Microsoft Defender reduces context switching, automatically detects and disrupts attacks across expanded estates including non-Microsoft products, multicloud and multiplatform environments, and embeds Microsoft Copilot for Security for the relevant tasks at hand.
