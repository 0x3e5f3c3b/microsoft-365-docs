# Choose between guided and advanced modes when hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

When you go to the **advanced hunting** page, you can choose from the following modes:
- **Guided mode** – craft queries with the query builder
- **Advanced mode** – craft KQL queries with the query editor 

The main difference between the two modes is that the advanced mode requires the user to know the KQL language in order to create a query from scratch. Guided mode, on the other hand, has an easy-to-use, visual, building block style of constructing queries through dropdown filters and conditions. 

## Take the tour

When you open the advanced hunting page for the first time after guided hunting is made available to you, you are invited to take the tour to learn more about the different parts of the page like the tabs and query areas. Select **Try out guided hunting** when it appears once you open the **advanced hunting** page from the left-hand navigation pane in Microsoft 365 Defender.

This takes you through the tour, which suggests some queries to get you started, like how to get a list of high-confidence phishing emails sent to your organization, a list of activities performed by a file you specify, or a list of alerts where a certain user is involved. These sample queries can be found in the **Getting started** section. Simply select **Load example** to edit the query, and run it by selecting **Run query**.

You can take the tour again at any time by going to **Help resources** > **Learn more** and selecting **Take the tour**.
