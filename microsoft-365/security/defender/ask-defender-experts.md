## Request advanced threat expertise on demand

Select **Ask Defender Experts** directly inside the Microsoft Defender XDR portal to get swift and accurate responses to all your threat questions. Experts can provide insights to better understand the complex threats your organization might face. Consult an expert to:

- Gather additional information on alerts and incidents, including root causes and scope.
- Gain clarity into suspicious devices, alerts, or incidents and get the next steps if faced with an advanced attacker.
- Determine risks and available protections related to activity groups, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> Ask Defender Experts is not a security incident response service. It's intended to provide a better understanding of complex threats affecting your organization. Engage with your own security incident response team to address urgent security incident response issues. If you don't have your own security incident response team and would like Microsoft's help, create a support request in the [Premier Services Hub](/services-hub/).

The option to **Ask Defender Experts** is available in the incidents and alerts pages for you to ask contextual questions about a specific incident or alert:
