# Auditing

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

As a tenant administrator, you can use Microsoft Purview to search the audit logs for the times Microsoft Defender Experts signed into your tenant and the actions they performed there to perform their investigations. You can also search the audit logs for the changes done by your tenant administrators to the Defender Experts settings.

Note that [Audit (Standard)](../defender/compliance/audit-solutions-overview) is turned on by default for all Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR customers when paid licenses are assigned to the tenant. If you have a trial license, your service delivery manager will work with you to turn on Audit if it isnâ€™t yet.
