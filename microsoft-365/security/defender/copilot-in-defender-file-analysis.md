# Analyze files with Microsoft Copilot for Security in Microsoft Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender
- Microsoft Defender XDR

> [!IMPORTANT]

[Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) in Microsoft Defender enables security teams to quickly identify malicious and suspicious files through AI-powered file analysis capabilities.

Security operations teams tracking and resolving attacks need tools and techniques to quickly analyze potentially malicious files. Sophisticated attacks often use files that mimic legitimate or system files to avoid detection. In addition, new-to-the-field security analysts might require time and gain significant experience to use available analysis tools and techniques available.

The file analysis capability of Copilot in Defender reduces the barrier to learning file analysis by immediately delivering reliable and complete file investigation results. This capability empowers security analysts from all levels to complete their investigation with a shorter turnaround time.

> [!NOTE]
> The file analysis capability is also available in the Copilot for Security standalone experience through the Microsoft Defender XDR plugin. Know more about [preinstalled plugins in Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/manage-plugins#preinstalled-plugins).

## Analyze a file

The file analysis results generated by Copilot usually contains the following information:

- **Overview** - contains an assessment of the file, including a detection name when the file is malicious/potentially unwanted, important file information like certificates and signer, and a summary of the contents of the file that contributes to the assessment.
- **Details** - highlights *Strings* found in the file, lists *API calls* that the file uses, and lists information of the file’s relevant *Certificates*.

> [!NOTE]
> The analysis results vary depending on the contents of the file.

You can access the file analysis capability through these steps:

1. Open a file page. Copilot automatically generates the device summary when opening a file page. The results, which shows the overview information by default, are then displayed on the Copilot pane. Select **Show details** to display the file’s information in full.

  **[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF FILE PAGE WITH FULL DETAILS DISPLAYED]**
2. From an incident page, choose a file to investigate in the [attack story](investigate-incidents.md#attack-story) graph. Select **Analyze** on the side pane to begin analysis. The results are then displayed on the Copilot pane.
  **[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF FILE DETAILS PANE IN AN INCIDENT PAGE]**
3. Review the results. Provide feedback about the results by navigating to the bottom of the Copilot pane and selecting the feedback icon.
