Data security is threatened by various attacks today, such as business email compromise (BEC), ransomware, organizational breaches, and nation-state attacks. These attacks often use lateral movement and can be hard to detect with high confidence in the early stages. Microsoft 365 Defender, through built-in deception capability, delivers high confidence signals on the early stages of these attacks, preventing attacks from reaching an organization's critical assets.

The Microsoft 365 Defender built-in deception feature gives important information and alerts security teams. The feature is designed to provide high-confidence detections and disruption of human-operated lateral movement. With deception built in, you can automatically deploy decoys and lures to attract attackers without having the need for additional appliances or deployments. When enabled, Microsoft 365 Defender alerts defenders once an attacker is tricked by a false trap set up by the deception technology. The defenders can then use the information to investigate the activity and observe the attacker's methods and strategies.  

This article gives an overview of the deception feature, requirements to enable the feature, and additional resources.
