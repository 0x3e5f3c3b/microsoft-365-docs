# Deploy and configure Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

Microsoft 365 Defender setup guides give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying your tenant, apps, and services. 

All setup guides are available in the Microsoft 365 admin center as described in the section below, and most guides can also be found in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal.

## Setup Guides

Setup guides in the admin center require authentication to a Microsoft 365 tenant as an administrator or other role with access to the admin center, but guides in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal can be accessed by anyone. We have provided links to both locations for each guide, where available, in the tables below.
