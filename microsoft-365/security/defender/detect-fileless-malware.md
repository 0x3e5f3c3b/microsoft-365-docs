# Detect fileless malware in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease](../includes/prerelease.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

As the threat landscape evolves, there's a rise in evasive memory-based attacks, also known as, fileless attacks. This shift in attacker techniques requires security tools to improve and hunt threats more effectively.

As antivirus solutions become better and better at pinpointing malicious files, the natural evolution of malware is to shift to attack chains that use as few files as possible. While fileless techniques used to be employed almost exclusively in sophisticated cyberattacks, they are now becoming widespread in common malware, too.

Microsoft actively monitors the security landscape to identify new threat trends and develop solutions that continuously enhance security and mitigate classes of threats. 

## Fileless threats

What exactly are fileless threats? The term "fileless" suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, such as a backdoor that lives only in the memory of a machine. However, there's no single definition for fileless malware. The term is used broadly, and sometimes to describe malware families that do rely on files to operate.

Attacks generally involve several stages for functionalities like execution, persistence, or information theft. Some parts of the attack chain may be fileless, while others may involve the file system in some form.

For more information, see [Fileless threats](/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/fileless-threats).

## Detect fileless threats

Due to the nature of fileless threats, the attacks and vectors can be highly variable. That is why there is no one ideal way to search for specific fileless threats. The context of a specific attack should include the indicators and entities that you need to investigate. 

### Use Microsoft 365 incident and alert queues

Microsoft 365 Defender includes an incident view that brings together different alerts across your Microsoft 365 environment to help tell a comprehensive story about an attack. This view can help you not only see potentially fileless malware running in your organization, but specific alerts across endpoints for you to investigate.

For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Defender Incident queue](incidents-overview.md).

### Use advanced hunting

Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can use advanced hunting to detect and stop fileless malware. For more information, see [Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting](../defender-endpoint\advanced-hunting-overview.md). 

#### Example 1

Add 3 AHQ queries to explain the different fileless threats and how they are detected. 

### Use threat analytics

Threat analytics is a set of reports from expert Microsoft security researchers covering the most relevant threats. Each report provides a detailed analysis of a threat and extensive guidance on how to defend against that threat. For more information, see [Track and respond to emerging threats through threat analytics](../defender-endpoint\threat-analytics.md).
