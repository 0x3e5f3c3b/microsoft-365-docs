# Enable the evaluation environment for Microsoft Cloud App Security


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

This article is [Step 2 of 2](eval-defender-mcas-overview.md) in the process of setting up the evaluation environment for Microsoft Cloud App Security. For more information about this process, see the [overview article](eval-defender-mcas-overview.md).

This article walks you through the process of accessing the Cloud App Security portal and configuring the necessary integration to collect cloud app traffic data. 

To discover cloud apps used in your environment, you can do one or both of the following:
- Get up and running quickly with Cloud Discovery by integrating with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This native integration enables you to immediately start collecting data on cloud traffic across your Windows 10 devices, on and off your network.
- To discover all cloud apps accessed by all devices connected to your network, deploy the Cloud App Security log collector on your firewalls and other proxies. This collects data from your endpoints and sends it to Cloud App Security for analysis. Cloud App Security natively integrates with some third-party proxies for even more capabilities.

This article includes guidance for both methods.

Use the following steps to set up Microsoft Cloud App Security.
