# Pilot Microsoft Defender for Office

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Introduction --
1. Create pilot groups
1. Configure protection
1. Try out capabilities

![Steps for creating the pilot for Microsoft 365 Defender for Office](../../media/defender/m365-defender-office-pilot.png)



## Step 1: Create pilot groups

add instructions


## Step 2: Configure protection

Some capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 are configured and turned on by default, but you'll want to raise the level of protection from the default. Some capabilities are not yet configured. You have three options for configuring protection:
- **Assign preset security policies** — Preset security policies are provided as a method to quickly assign a uniform level of protection across all of the capabilities. You can choose from standard or strict. One approach is to start with preset security policies and then fine-tune the policies as you learn more about the capabilies and your own unique threat environment. 
- **Configure baseline protection manually** — If you prefer to configure the environment yourself, you can quickly achieve a baseline of protection by following the guidance in [Protect against threats](../office-365-security/protect-against-threats.md). With this approach you get to learn more about the settings that are configurable. And, of course, you can fine-tune the policies later.
- **Configure custom protection policies** — You can also build and assign custom protection policies as part of your evaluation. Before you start customizing policies, it's important to understand the precedence in which these protection policies are applied and enforced.

### Option 1: Assign preset security policies

### Option 2: Configure baseline protection manually

### Option 3: Configure custom protection policies


## Step 3: Try out capabilities

Now that your pilot is set up and configured, it's helpful to become familiar with the reporting and attack simulation tools that are unique to Microsoft Defender for Microsoft 365.


|Capability  |Description  |More information  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Row1     |         |         |
|Threat Explorer     | Threat Explorer is a powerful near real-time tool to help Security Operations teams investigate and respond to threats and displays information about suspected malware and phish in email and files in Office 365, as well as other security threats and risks to your organization.        | [Views in Threat Explorer and real-time detections ](../office-365-security/threat-explorer-views.md)       |
|Attack Simulator     | You can use Attack Simulator in the Security & Compliance Center to run realistic attack scenarios in your organization which help you identify and find vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your environment.        |  [Attack Simulator in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](../office-365-security/attack-simulator.md)       |
