# Create the Microsoft 365 Defender Evaluation Environment

- [**Return to the Overview** 'Evaluate and pilot Microsoft 365 Defender' | Microsoft Docs](../office-365-security/defender/eval-overview.md) 
- [Establishing the Evaluation Environment](#establishing-the-evaluation-environment)

There are two common ways to do this. The first is to [build an environment from scratch](m365d-evaluation.md) for the purpose of evaluation. It may not have many real signals from the business, so be aware of that caveat. This document assume you already have a production M365 tenant, and will activate E5 trial licenses to evaluate M365 Defender in *the current environment* in order to ultimately retain these features with the purchase of licenses after the evaluation period.
