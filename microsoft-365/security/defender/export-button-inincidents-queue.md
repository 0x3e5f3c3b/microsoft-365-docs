# Export button to migrate incidents queue data to CSV files

We are thrilled to announce that the new "export button" feature in the Microsoft 365 Defender incident queue is now available in public preview.

This feature provides the following functionalities:
- Quick export of the incident queue-related data to a CSV file.
- Export of data based on filters and customizable time ranges(for more information, see Filters and time ranges)

## Filters and time ranges

The **Export** button enables you to migrate data that is determined by filters or time range-based data to a CSV file.

For example, you want to create reports to :
- get an idea of how many high-severity incidents you had in the last 30 days
- to know who is your most productive analyst. 

You can quickly export this data from the incident page to a CSV file and find out.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Export** button also allows you to export data that is not based on filters or customized time ranges. Data based on filters and time ranges is another a subfeature provided by the **Export** button.

If you have thoughts or suggestions about the new **Export** button for the incident queue, contact Microsoft team or send your feedback through the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
