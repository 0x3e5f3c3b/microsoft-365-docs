# Respond to your first incident-Perform post-incident activities

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends that once all steps have been taken to recover from the attack, organizations must learn and improve from the incident. Assessing the different aspects of incident-handling become important in preparing for the next incident.

Microsoft 365 Defender can assist in performing post-incident activities by providing an organization with alerts that align with [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/). All Microsoft Defender solutions label attacks in accordance with an ATT&CK tactic or technique. 

By mapping alerts to this industry framework, you can:

- Conduct an analysis on gaps in security coverage.
- Determine adversary and campaign attribution.
- Perform trend analysis.
- Identify skill gaps in attack method awareness. 

Post-incident review activity can result in fine-tuning your security configuration and security team's skills and processes, enhancing your organizationâ€™s response capabilities.
