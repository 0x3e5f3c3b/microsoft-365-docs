| **How is Defender Experts for XDR different from Defender Experts for Hunting?** | Defender Experts for Hunting provides threat hunting service to proactively find threats. This service is meant for customers with a robust security operations center and wants that deep expertise in hunting to expose advanced threats. Defender Experts for XDR provide end-to-end security operations capabilities to monitor, investigate and respond to security alerts. This service is meant for customers with constrained security operations centers that are overburdened with alert volume, in need of skilled experts or both. Defender Experts for XDR also includes the proactive threat hunting offered by Defender Experts for Hunting. |
