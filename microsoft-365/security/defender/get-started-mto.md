# Microsoft 365 Defender Multi-Tenant Organization Unified View

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)
- Microsoft 365 Defender Multi-Tenant Organization

Microsoft 365 Defender Multi-Tenant Organization Unified View is a unified experience where you can monitor and manage security across your enterprise. With the integrated alerts across identities, endpoints, data, apps, email, and collaboration tools - investigating and responding to threats now happen in a central location.

## Verify your tenant access

Before you start, make sure that you have the appropriate permissions for accessing multiple tenants using a single identity.

To access data from other tenants within the Microsoft 365 Defender Multi-Tenant Organization portal, you must have one of the following for each of the tenants that you intend to view and manage:

- [Granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction)
- [Azure Active Directory B2B authentication](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b)

>[!Note]
> Setting up multi-factor authentication trust is highly recommended for each tenant to avoid missing data in the Microsoft 365 Defender Multi-Tenant Organization portal.

### Verify your tenant access with Azure Active Directory B2B

1. Go to [My account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/organizations)
2. Under **Organizations > Other organizations you collaborate with** youâ€™ll see the list of organizations you have guest access to.
