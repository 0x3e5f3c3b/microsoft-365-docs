# Incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

> Want to experience Microsoft 365 Defender? You can [evaluate it in a lab environment](m365d-evaluation.md?ocid=cx-docs-MTPtriallab) or [run your pilot project in production](m365d-pilot.md?ocid=cx-evalpilot).

An incident in Microsoft 365 Defender is a collection of correlated alerts and associated data that make up the story of an attack. 

Microsoft 365 services and apps create alerts when they detect a suspicious malicious event or activity. Individual alerts provide valuable clues about an completed or ongoing attack. However, attacks typically employ various techniques against different types of entities, such as devices, users, and mailboxes. The result is multiple alerts for multiple entities in your tenant. 

Because piecing the individual alerts together to gain insight into an attack can be challenging and time-consuming, Microsoft 365 Defender automatically aggregates the alerts and their associated information into an incident.

Grouping related alerts into an incident gives you a comprehensive view of an attack. For example, you can see:

- Where the attack started.
- What tactics were used.
- How far the attack has gone into your tenant.
- The scope of the attack, such as how many devices, users, and mailboxes were impacted. 
- How severe is the impact.
- All of the data associated with the attack.

If enabled, Microsoft 365 Defender can automatically investigate and resolve alerts through automation and artificial intelligence. You can also perform additional remediation steps to resolve the attack from the incidents itself. 

## Incidents and alerts in the Microsoft 365 security center

You manage incidents from ***Incidents & alerts > Incidents** on the quick launch of the Microsoft 365 security center ([security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)).

Selecting an incident name displays a summary of the incident and provides access to additional information.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converged-incident-info-3.png" alt-text="Example of the Summary page for an incidentÂ in the Microsoft 365 security center":::

The additional tabs for any incident are:

- Alerts 

  All the alerts related to the incident and their information.

- Devices

  All the devices where alerts related to the incident.

- Users

  All the users that have been identified to be part of or related to the incident.

- Mailboxes

  All the mailboxes that have been identified to be part of or related to the incident.

- Investigations

  All the automated investigations triggered by alerts in the incident.

- Evidence and Response

  All the supported events and suspicious entities in the alerts in the incident.

Here is the relationship an incident and its data to the tabs of an incident in the Microsoft 365 security center.

The incident queue show the incidents from the last 30 days. From here, you can:

- See which incidents should be [prioritized](incident-queue.md) based on risk level and other factors. 
- Perform an [investigation](investigate-incidents.md) of an incident.
- [Manage incidents](manage-incidents.md), which includes renaming, assigning them to individual analysts, classifying, and adding tags for your incident management workflow.
