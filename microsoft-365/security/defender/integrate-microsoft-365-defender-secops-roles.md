# Step 4. Define Microsoft 365 Defender roles, responsibilities, and oversight

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

Your organization must establish ownership and accountability of the Microsoft 365 Defender licenses, configurations, and administration as one of the pre-emptive tasks before any operational roles can be defined. Typically, the ownership of the licenses, subscription costs, and administration of Microsoft 365 and Enterprise Security + Mobility (EMS) services (which may include Microsoft 365 Defender) fall outside the SOC teams. The SOC team should work with those individuals to ensure proper oversight of Microsoft 365 Defender. 

Many modern SOCs assign its team members to categories based on their skillsets and functions. For example:

- A Threat Intelligence Team assigned to tasks related to lifecycle management of Threat and Analytics functions
- A Monitoring Team comprised of SOC analysts responsible for maintaining logs, alerts, events, and monitoring functions
- An Engineering & Operations Team assigned to engineer and optimize security devices.

SOC team roles and responsibilities for Microsoft 365 Defender would naturally integrate into these teams.

The following table breaks out each SOC teamâ€™s roles and responsibilities, and how their roles integrate with Microsoft 365 Defender.
