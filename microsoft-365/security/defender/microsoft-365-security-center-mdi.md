# Microsoft Defender for Identity in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](microsoft-365-defender.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/)

Microsoft Defender for Identity is now part of Microsoft 365 Defender. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal allows security admins to perform their security tasks in one location. This will simplify workflows, and add the functionality of the other Microsoft 365 Defender services. Microsoft 365 Defender will be the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. 

Microsoft Defender for Identity contributes identity focused information into the incidents and alerts that Microsoft 365 Defender presents. This information is key to providing context and correlating alerts from the other products within Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Advantages of the converged portal

Microsoft 365 Defender now includes all functionality provided in the classic Defender for Identity portal. While they may not be in exactly same pages, much of your data is integrated into Microsoft 365 Defender pages so that you can view your data across all of your monitored entities.

For example:

|Area  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Security posture management assessments**    |    All the identity security posture management assessments that were previously accessible in Defender for Cloud Apps are now available in Microsoft Secure Score, which can be found at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore> in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). For more information, see  [Microsoft Defender for Identity's security posture assessments](/defender-for-identity/security-assessment).     |
|**Search**     | Global search in Microsoft 365 Defender (using the search bar at the top of the page) allows security teams to look for any entity being monitored by Microsoft 365 Defender, be it identity, endpoint, Office 365 data, and more. Results can be interacted with directly from the search drop-down, or security teams can choose to select **All users** or **All devices**  to see all entities associated with that search term.        |
|**Onboarding**     |  The onboarding process is now automatic for new customers, with no need to manually configure a workspace. Additionally, all the admin features are available under the **Identities** menu in Microsoft 365 Defender's Settings.       |
|**Alerts and incident correlation**     |  Defender for Identity alerts are now included in Microsoft 365 Defender's alert queue, making them available to the auto incident correlation feature. This ensures that all alerts are available in one place, and that the scope of a breach can be determined quicker than before. For more information, see [Defender for Identity security alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/manage-security-alerts).       |
|**Advanced hunting**     |   Proactively search for threats and malicious activity by using advanced hunting queries. These powerful queries can be used to locate and review threat indicators and entities for both known and potential threats. <br><br>Custom detection rules can be built from advanced hunting queries to help you proactively watch for events that might be indicative of breach activity and misconfigured devices. For more information, see [Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender](advanced-hunting-overview.md).      |
|**Alert exclusions and tuning**     | The alert interface is more user friendly, including adding a useful search function and global exclusions. Global exclusions means that any entity can be excluded from all alerts generated by Defender for Identity, helping with any testing scenarios you may have. For more information, see [Configure Defender for Identity detection exclusions in Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/exclusions).  |
| **Remediation actions** | Defender for Identity remediation actions, such as disabling accounts or requiring password resets, can now be taken from the Microsoft 365 Defender user details page. For more information, see [Remediation actions in Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/remediation-actions). |
| **Lateral movement paths** | In addition to the **Lateral movement paths** tab on the user details page, lateral movement paths can also be discovered via the **Advanced hunting** page and the **Lateral movement paths** security assessment. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity Lateral Movement Paths (LMPs)](/defender-for-identity/understand-lateral-movement-paths).|
