# Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant advanced hunting

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

## Advanced hunting

Advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant allows you to proactively hunt for intrusion attempts and breach activity affecting your email, data, devices, and accounts over multiple tenants at the same time.

## Run cross tenant queries

In multi-tenant view, you can use any of the queries you currently have access to. They are filtered by tenant in the Queries tab. Select a tenant to view the queries under each:

Once you have loaded the query in the query editor, you can then specify the scope of the query by tenant by selecting Tenant scope.

This opens a side pane from which you can specify the tenants to include in the query.

>[!NOTE]
>Queries that use the `join` operator are currently not supported in multi-tenant advanced hunting.

From the Advanced hunting page you can run your cross-tenant query by selecting **Tenant scope**. This query will run on the combined data set of all the tenants you've selected.

The query results contains the tenant id:
