## Advanced Hunting

The unified advanced hunting experience allows you to proactively hunt for intrusion attempts and breach activity affecting your email, data, devices, and accounts over multiple tenants at the same time.

1. Go to [Advance Hunting](https://mto.security.microsoft.com/v2/advanced-hunting)

2. **Run** your cross-tenant query. It will run on the combined data set of all the tenants you are authorized to access.
3. A new **TenantID** column exists in the query results
4. You can restrict the query to a specific set of tenants by selecting **Tenant scope** at the top right corner of the page
5. On the left, you can see the **unified schema**, which displays all tables available across all tenants.
