The Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant portal [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) is the one-stop shop where you use and manage Defender for Business. It includes callouts to help you get started, cards that surface relevant information, and a navigation bar that provides easy access to the various features and capabilities.

## The navigation bar

Use the navigation bar on the left side of the screen to access your incidents and alerts, view the vulnerability management dashboard, use advanced hunting and manage your tenants. The following table describes items you'll see in your navigation bar.

| Item | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Home** | Takes you to your home page in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The home page highlights any active threats that are detected, along with recommendations to help secure your company's data and devices.|
| **Incidents and alerts** | Takes you to your lists of recent incidents and alerts. As alerts are triggered, incidents are created. An incident can include multiple alerts. Make sure to review your incidents regularly. |
