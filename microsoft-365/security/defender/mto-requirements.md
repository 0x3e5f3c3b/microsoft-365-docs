## Verify your tenant access

To view the data you have access to across multiple tenants in Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant view, you need to ensure you have the necessary permissions. You'll need one of the following for each tenant you want to view and manage:

- [Azure Active Directory B2B authentication](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b)
- [Granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction)

>[!Note]
> Setting up [multi-factor authentication trust](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access) is highly recommended for each tenant to avoid missing data in the Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant view.

### Verify your tenant access with Azure Active Directory B2B

1. Go to [My account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/organizations)
2. Under **Organizations > Other organizations you collaborate with** youâ€™ll see the list of organizations you have guest access to.

3. Verify all the tenants you plan to manage in the Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant view appear in the list.
4. For each tenant, go to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/?tid=tenant_id) and log in to validate you can successfully access the tenant.

### Verify your tenant access with GDAP

1. Go to the [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/commerce/granularadminaccess/list).
2. Under **Customers** you can find the list of organizations you have guest access to.
3. Verify all the tenants you plan to manage in the Microsoft 365 Defender multi-tenant view appear in the list.
4. For each tenant, go to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal)](https://security.microsoft.com/?tid=tenant_id) and login to validate you can successfully access the tenant.
