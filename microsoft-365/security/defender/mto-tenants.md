# Manage tenants

- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

[!include[Prerelease information](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

To view the list of tenants that appear in the multi-tenant view, go to [Settings page](https://mto.security.microsoft.com/mtosettings) in the multi-tenant view in Microsoft 365 Defender:

From the **Settings** page you can:

- **Add a tenant**: Select **Add tenant** > Choose the tenants to want to add > Select **Add tenant**. Selecting a tenant from the list opens the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) for that tenant.

- **Remove a tenant**: Select the tenant you'd like to remove > select **Remove**.

## Multi-tenant view status indicator

The Multi-tenant view status indicator is always available in the bottom right corner of the multi-tenant view in Microsoft 365 Defender. This indicator provides information when data issues occur with the page you're viewing, such as data loading issues or permissions issues.

When an issue exists, the status indicator shows a red warning sign and hovering over it displays the issues that have occurred and the tenant information. By expanding each section, youâ€™ll see all the tenants with this issue.
