### Collaborate with Experts on Demand

> [!NOTE]
> Experts on Demand is included in your Defender Experts for Hunting subscription with monthly allocations. However, it's not a security incident response service. It's intended to provide a better understanding of complex threats affecting your organization. Engage with your own security incident response team to address urgent security incident response issues. If you don't have your own security incident response team and would like Microsoft's help, create a support request in the [Premier Services Hub](/services-hub/).

Click the **Ask Defender Experts** button  directly inside the Microsoft 365 security portal to get  swift and accurate responses to all your threat hunting questions. Experts can provide insight to better understand the complex threats your organization may face. Experts on Demand can help to: 

- Gather additional information on alerts and incidents, including root causes and scope
- Gain clarity into suspicious devices, alerts, or incidents and take next steps if faced with an advanced attacker
- Determine risks and available protections related to threat actors, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques

The option to '**Ask Defender Experts**' is available in several places throughout the portal:

- Device page actions menu
