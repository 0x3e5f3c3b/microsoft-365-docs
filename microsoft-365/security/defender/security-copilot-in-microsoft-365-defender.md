# Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

The Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender Early Access Program is an invitation-only, paid preview. If your organization is interested in this program, work with your Microsoft account manager to learn more about nominations for a potential invite. To learn more about this program, see the [Security Copilot Early Access Program](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot.md).

[Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot.md) is a platform that brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help security teams respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Security Copilot is embedded in Microsoft 365 Defender to provide security teams with the capabilities to summarize incidents, analyze scripts and codes, use guided responses to resolve incidents, generate KQL queries, and create incident reports.

This article provides an overview for users of the Security Copilot embedded experience in Microsoft 365 Defender, including steps to access, key capabilities, and links that detail these capabilities.

## Access Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender

Review Security Copilot and assess if it's right for your organization, see the [Security Copilot Frequently Asked Questions](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot.md) page. To ensure that you have access to Security Copilot, see [Security Copilot licensing information](/security-copilot/faq-security-copilot.md#licensing-information).

[Review information on other requirements to access Security Copilot](/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot.md).

## Key features

Microsoft 365 Defender brings the capabilities of Security Copilot to the portal, enabling security teams to tackle attack investigations in a timely manner with ease and precision. Bringing AI to Microsoft 365 Defender allows teams to understand attacks immediately, promptly assess and apply appropriate mitigation to stop and contain attacks, quickly analyze complex files, and hunt for threats with ease.

### Summarize incidents quickly

Investigating incidents with multiple alerts can be a daunting task. To immediately understand an incident, you can tap Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender to [summarize an incident](security-copilot-m365d-incident-summary.md) for you. Security Copilot creates an overview of the attack containing essential information for you to understand what transpired in the attack, what assets are involved, and the timeline of the attack. Security Copilot automatically creates a summary when you navigate to an incident's page.

### Take action on incidents through guided response

Approaching solutions and mitigation for any incident can oftentimes be complex for several reasons, including understanding where to begin, what solutions are appropriate, and following new investigation flows for security teams. Security Copilot minimizes these complications through [guided responses](security-copilot-m365d-guided-response.md). These responses are recommended actions specific to each incident.

### Get results fast when analyzing scripts and codes

Most attackers rely on sophisticated malware and files when launching attacks to avoid detection and investigation. These files are usually obfuscated and arrive as scripts, Powershell, batch, and bash. Security Copilot can quickly analyze these types of files to facilitate faster investigation, reducing the time for [script or code analysis](security-copilot-m365d-script-analysis.md) and helping security teams decide on the next action steps using information about these filesâ€™ capabilities.

### Generate KQL queries from natural-language input 

Security teams who use advanced hunting to proactively hunt for threats in their network can now use a query assistant that converts any natural-language question in the context of threat hunting, into a ready-to-run KQL query. The query assistant saves security teams time by generating a KQL query that can then be automatically run or further tweaked according to the analyst needs. Read more about the query assistant in [Security Copilot in advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-security-copilot.md)

### Write post-investigation reports with speed and accuracy

Investigation conclusions usually require reports to document the attack, the steps taken, results of the investigation, and other post-analysis items that need to be recorded to aid future security decisions and learning. Oftentimes, documenting investigations can be time-consuming and needs to have accurate information to be effective. Security Copilot [creates incident reports](security-copilot-m365d-create-incident-report.md) to summarize the investigation upon closure.
