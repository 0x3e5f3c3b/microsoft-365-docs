# Create an incident report with Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease](../includes/prerelease.md)]

[Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender assists security operations teams in simplifying investigation documentation. Utilizing Security Copilotâ€™s AI-powered data processing, security teams can immediately create accurate incident reports within Microsoft 365 Defender.

Incident responders usually conclude investigations by writing a report that includes a summary of the incident, a timeline of what happened and what remediation and solutions were deployed, the team members involved in the investigation, and recommendations moving forward. This document is essential for current and future security decision making and investigations. However, putting together all the elements for the documentation can be time-consuming. Security teams can now instantly create an incident report within the portal with Security Copilot.

This guide outlines what to expect and how to access the incident report creation capability of Security Copilot within Microsoft 365 Defender, including information on how to provide feedback.

## Technical requirements

[Learn about the requirements for Security Copilot to get started](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements.md).

## Create an incident report

Security Copilot helps you create an incident report that includes:

- An [overview of the incident](security-copilot-m365d-incident-summary.md) or attack.
- The team members who responded to the incident, including the response actions and timeframe for each member involved.
- The investigation actions and mitigation done.
- The conclusion of the investigation.
- Gaps and follow-up requirements to be addressed.

To create an incident report:

1. Select an incident. In the incident page, select **Generate incident report** located at the top right corner of the page.
