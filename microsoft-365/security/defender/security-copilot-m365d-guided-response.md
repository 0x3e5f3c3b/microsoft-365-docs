# Use guided responses with Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article only applies to the Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program, an invite-only paid preview program for commercial customers. Some information in this article relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

[Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender supports incident response teams in immediately applying remediation actions while investigating attacks with guided responses. Security Copilot and Microsoft 365 Defender use both AI and machine learning capabilities to contextualize an incident and to learn from previous investigations to generate appropriate response actions.

Responding to incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender often require familiarity with the portal's available actions to stop attacks. In addition, new incident responders might have different ideas of where and how to start responding to incidents. The guided response capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender enables incident response teams in all levels to confidently and quickly apply response actions to resolve incidents with ease.

This guide outlines how to access the guided response capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender, including information on providing feedback about the responses.

## Technical requirements

[Learn about the requirements for Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements.md).

## Use guided responses to resolve incidents

Guided responses recommend actions in the following categories:

- Triage
- Containment
- Remediation
- Investigation

Each response is separated into different cards per category. Each card contains information about the recommended action, including the entity where the action will be applied and why the action is recommended.

To use guided responses, perform the following steps:

1. Select an incident from the queue. Security Copilot pane appears in the incident page. Security Copilot automatically generates guided responses when you open an incident page.

2. Review the guided response card generated by Security Copilot.

3. On the Triage card, you can classify an alert by selecting an option from the dropdown menu.

4. Review and apply each response generated by Security Copilot on the Containment, Remediation, and Investigation cards. Note that some cards might not be applicable for each incident. For example, the Investigation card is not applicable for incidents that are already resolved.
5. When an action is grayed out, it means that you might not have permissions to perform the action. [Refer to the Security Copilot licensing requirements](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements.md) for more information.

Security Copilot and Microsoft 365 Defender make it easy for incident response teams to gain more context about actions with additional insights. For remediation responses, incident response teams can view additional information with options like **View similar incidents** or **View similar emails**.

The **View similar incidents** action takes you to the Similar incidents tab, when applicable. This tab lists similar incidents within the organization that you can review.

The **View similar emails** action takes you to the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) page, where a  KQL query to list similar emails within the organization is automatically generated. This automatic query generation related to an incident helps incident response teams further investigate other emails that might be related to the incident. You can review the query and modify it as needed.
