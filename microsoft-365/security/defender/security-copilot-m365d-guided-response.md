[Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) in Microsoft 365 Defender supports incident response teams in applying remediation actions while investigating attacks. Responding to incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender often require familiarity with the portal's available actions to stop attacks. Security Copilot draws upon the context of an incident and learning from prior investigations to generate appropriate responses. Using the responses generated and their assessment of the responses allow incident response teams to quickly resolve incidents.

These guided responses are generated using the following context of an incident:

- The incident is associated with phishing or malware.

This guide outlines how to access the guided response capability of Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender, including information on providing feedback.

## Technical requirements

[Learn about the requirements for Security Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements.md).

## Use guided responses to resolve incidents

Guided responses recommend actions to take to resolve an incident. These recommended actions are categorized into:

- Triage - where you can classify an alert.
- Containment - where you can select specific actions to stop an attack.
- Remediation - where you can select specific actions to remediate an attack.

To use guided responses:

1. Select an incident from the queue. Security Copilot automatically generates the incident summary and guided responses when you open an incident page.
2. Review each of the responses generated by Security Copilot.
3. In the Triage response, you can classify an alert as a false positive or true positive. Select **False positive** or **True positive** to classify the alert.
4. In the Containment response, select **Isolate device** to contain an attack.
5. In the Remediation response, you can select an appropriate action to remediate an attack. Select the actions you want to take.

## Managing feedback
