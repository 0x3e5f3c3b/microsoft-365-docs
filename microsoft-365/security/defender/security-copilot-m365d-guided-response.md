# Resolve incidents with guided responses from Microsoft Copilot for Security in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR

[Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) in Microsoft Defender XDR supports incident response teams in immediately resolving incidents with guided responses. Copilot for Security and Microsoft Defender XDR use AI and machine learning capabilities to contextualize an incident and learn from previous investigations to generate appropriate response actions.

Responding to incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR often requires familiarity with the portal's available actions to stop attacks. In addition, new incident responders might have different ideas of where and how to start responding to incidents. The guided response capability of Copilot for Security in Microsoft Defender XDR allows incident response teams at all levels to confidently and quickly apply response actions to resolve incidents with ease.

This guide outlines how to access the guided response capability, including information on providing feedback about the responses.

> [!NOTE]
> The guided response capability is also available in the Copilot for Security standalone experience through the Microsoft Defender XDR plugin. Know more about [preinstalled plugins in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/manage-plugins#preinstalled-plugins).

## Apply guided responses to resolve incidents

Guided responses recommend actions in the following categories:

- Triage - includes a recommendation to classify incidents as informational, true positive, or false positive
- Containment - includes recommended actions to contain an incident
- Investigation - includes recommended actions for further investigation
- Remediation - includes recommended response actions to apply to specific entities involved in an incident

Each card contains information about the recommended action, including the entity where the action needs to be applied and why the action is recommended.

To use guided responses, perform the following steps:

1. Open an incident page. Copilot automatically generates guided responses upon opening an incident page.

2. Review the guided response cards before applying the recommendations.

3. **Classify the incident** by selecting an option from the dropdown menu on the Triage card. You can classify the incident as true positive, informational, or false positive.
4. Review and apply each response generated by Copilot on the Containment, Investigation, and Remediation cards. You can provide feedback to each recommended action to continually enhance future responses.
5. Actions that are grayed out might mean they are unavailable to you due to insufficient permission. [Refer to the unified role-based access (RBAC) permissions](manage-rbac.md) page for more information.

Copilot for Security and Microsoft Defender XDR support incident response teams by enabling analysts to gain more context about response actions with additional insights. For remediation responses, incident response teams can view additional information with options like **View similar incidents** or **View similar emails**.

The **View similar incidents** action becomes available when there are other incidents within the organization that are similar to the current incident. The Similar incidents tab lists similar incidents that you can review. Microsoft Defender XDR automatically identifies similar incidents within the organization through machine learning. Incident response teams can use the information from these similar incidents to classify incidents and further review the actions done in those similar incidents.

The **View similar emails** action, which is specific to phishing incidents, takes you to the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) page, where a KQL query to list similar emails within the organization is automatically generated. This automatic query generation related to an incident helps incident response teams further investigate other emails that might be related to the incident. You can review the query and modify it as needed.

## Managing feedback

You can validate or report the responses Copilot provides. Validating and reporting results improve Copilot's delivery of more accurate responses in the future.

Each response card has an option for providing feedback. [Follow these steps to provide your feedback about the results](security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender.md#provide-feedback-to-copilot).
