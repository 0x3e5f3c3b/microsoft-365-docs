# What's new in Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC)

This article provides information about new features and important product updates for the latest release of Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC).

## August 2023

- (Preview) File collection permissions (both direct and from the Live response console) can now be managed with Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC). Previously, users were assigned the Advanced Live response permission to access file collection capabilities, even though they did not need all of the associated permissions. This change ensures that users are only given the permission they need.
