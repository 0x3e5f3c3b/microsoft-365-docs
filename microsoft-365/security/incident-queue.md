# Incident queue in Microsoft 365

The **Incidents queue** shows a collection of incidents that were flagged from across devices, identities, and mailboxes. It helps you sort through incidents to prioritize and create an informed cybersecurity response decision.


By default, the queue in Microsoft 365 security center displays incidents seen in the last 30 days, with the most recent incident showing at the top of the list, helping you see the most recent incidents first.


There are several options you can choose from to customize the Incidents queue view. 

On the top navigation you can:
- Customize columns to add or remove columns 
- Modify the number of items to view per page
- Select the items to show per page
- Batch-select the incidents to assign 
- Navigate between pages
- Apply filters


## Sort and filter the incidents queue
You can apply the following filters to limit the list of incidents and get a more focused view.

### Severity
Incident severity | Description
:---|:---
High </br>(Red) | Threats often associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These incidents indicate a high risk due to the severity of damage they can inflict on machines.
Medium </br>(Orange) | Threats rarely observed in the organization, such as anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and observed behaviors typical of attack stages.
Low </br>(Yellow) | Threats associated with prevalent malware and hack-tools that do not necessarily indicate an advanced threat targeting the organization.
Informational </br>(Grey) | Informational incidents are those that might not be considered harmful to the network but might be good to keep track of.

### Assigned to
You can choose to show between unassigned incidents or those which are assigned to you.

### Status
You can choose to limit the list of incidents shown based on their status to see which ones are active or resolved.
