# Incidents overview in Microsoft 365


Incidents in Microsoft 365 are based on alerts. Alerts are generated when a malicious event is seen in an environment.

Malicious events on the following entities are surfaced in Microsoft 365 security center:
- Devices
- Identities
- Mailboxes


Correlation analytics are applied on individual alerts seen on entities. Malicious events that are identified to exhibit characteristics of being part of a larger attack is then aggregated into an incident.

Incidents in Microsoft 365 narrate the broader story of an attack by connecting the dots seen on individual alerts on entities. 


The platform provides security defenders with the right visuals and data representations to understand and address complex cross-entity threats. Not only will they have visibility on the scope of an attack, but they'll be able to take tactical steps on each entity to contain an incident.


The incident view provides detailed information on alerts that were seen, other ongoing investigations related to the incident, as well as other visuals to better narrate the scope of a threat.
