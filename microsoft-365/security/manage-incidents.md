# Manage incidents in Microsoft 365

Managing incidents is an important part of every cybersecurity operation. You can manage incidents by selecting an incident from the **Incidents queue**. You can assign incidents to yourself, change the status, classify, rename, or comment on them to keep track of their progress. 

Selecting an incident from the **Incidents queue** brings up the **Incident management pane** where you can open the incident page for details.

From the management pane, you'll be able to assign an incidents to yourself and change the status and classification. Opening the incident page allows you to take other management actions.
 
## Assign incidents
If an incident has not been assigned yet, you can select **Assign to me** to assign the incident to yourself. Doing so assumes ownership of not just the incident, but also all the alerts associated with it.

## Set status and classification
### Incident status
You can categorize incidents (as **Active**, or **Resolved**) by changing their status as your investigation progresses. This helps you organize and manage how your team can respond to incidents.

For example, your SOC analyst can review the urgent **Active** incidents for the day, and decide to assign them to herself for investigation.

Alternatively, your SOC analyst might set the incident as **Resolved** if the incident has been remediated. 

### Classification
You can choose not to set a classification, or decide to specify whether an incident is true or false. Doing so helps the team see patterns and learn from them.

### Add comments
You can add comments and view historical events about an incident to see previous changes made to it.

Whenever a change or comment is made to an alert, it is recorded in the Comments and history section.

Added comments instantly appear on the pane.
