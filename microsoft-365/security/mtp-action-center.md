# The Action center in Microsoft Threat Protection

**Applies to**:
- Microsoft 365

In Microsoft Threat Protection, an investigation occurs within the context of an incident that is created when an alert is triggered. The Action center provides a view of current and past investigations across Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Office 365 ATP, and Azure Active Directory Identity Protection. This not only enables your security operations team to operate more effectively and efficiently, it also provides a more comprehensive view of Microsoft Threat Protection at work for your organization. 

To go to the Action center, in the Microsoft 365 security center, in the navigation pane on the left side, choose Action center.) 

In the Action center, select Customize columns to show only the columns you want to see.
