# The Action center in Microsoft Threat Protection

In Microsoft Threat Protection, an investigation occurs within the context of an incident that is created when an alert is triggered. The **Action center** provides a view of current and past investigations across Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Office 365 ATP, and Azure Active Directory Identity Protection.
