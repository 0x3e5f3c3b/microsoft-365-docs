# Automatically investigate and remediate issues

**Applies to**:
- Microsoft 365

With [automated investigation and remediation](autoir-overview.md) (AIR) capabilities in Microsoft 365, security administrators can set up alerts that trigger investigations automatically, or start an automated investigation from a report in the Microsoft 365 security center. Once an investigation is underway, your security team can monitor progress, approve pending actions, and review the results. This article describes how to use AIR to automatically investigate and remediate cyber security issues in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator, security administrator, security operator, or security reader to perform the tasks described in this article. To learn more, see [Microsoft 365 security center: roles and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/microsoft-security-and-compliance#required-licenses-and-permissions).

## Set up alerts to trigger automated investigations

Certain [alert policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/alert-policies) can be set up to trigger automated investigations and remediation. For example, you can set up an alert such that if any email messages containing malware are detected after the messages are delivered, in addition to removing the infected messages with [zero-hour auto purge](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/zero-hour-auto-purge), an AIR process begins.
