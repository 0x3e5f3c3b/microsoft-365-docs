# Understand the advanced hunting schema

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection



The [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema is made up of multiple tables that provide either event information or information about machines and entities. To effectively build queries that span multiple tables, you need to understand the tables and the columns in the advanced hunting schema.

## Schema tables

The following reference lists all the tables in the schema. Each table name links to a page describing the column names for that table. Table and column names are also listed in the security center as part of the the schema representation on the advanced hunting screen.

| Table name | Description |
