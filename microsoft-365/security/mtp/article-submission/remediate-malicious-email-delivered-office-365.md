# Remediate malicious email that was delivered in Office 365

Remediation means taking a proscribed action against a threat. Malicious mails sent into your organization may be cleaned up either by the system, through ZAP (Zero-hour Auto-Purge), or by the security teams through remediation actions like move to inbox, move to junk, move to deleted items folder, soft delete, or hard delete. Office Advanced Threat Protection (Office ATP) P2 / E5 offers security operations teams the ability to mediate threats in emails and collaboration issues through manual hunting and automated investigations.

> [!NOTE]
> For security teams to remediate emails, they need to have search and purge role assigned to them. Role assignment is done through permissions in security and compliance center. 

# What you need to know before you begin

Admins can take required actions on emails but to get their action approved, they MUST have "search and Purge" role assigned to them via Security and Compliance Center > Permissions.
