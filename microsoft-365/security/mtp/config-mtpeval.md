# Configure Microsoft Threat Protection pillars for your trial lab or pilot environment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection


Creating a Microsoft Threat Protection trial lab or pilot environment and deploying it is a three-phase process:

You're currently in the configuration phase.


Preparation is key to any successful deployment. In this article, you'll be guided on the points you'll need to consider as you prepare to deploy Microsoft Defender ATP.


## Microsoft Threat Protection pillars
Microsoft Threat Protection consists of four pillars. Although one pillar can already provide value to your network organization's security, enabling the four Microsoft Threat Protection pillars will give your organization the most value.

This section will guide you to configure:
-	Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection
-	Azure Advanced Threat Protection 
-	Microsoft Cloud App Security
-	Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection


## Configure Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection

>[!NOTE]
>Skip this step if you've already enabled Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. 

There's a PowerShell Module called the *Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA)* that helps determine some of these settings. When run as an administrator in your tenant, get-ORCAReport will help generate an assessment of the anti-spam, anti-phish, and other message hygiene settings. You can download this module from https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/. 

1. Navigate to [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/homepage) > **Threat management** > **Policy**.
