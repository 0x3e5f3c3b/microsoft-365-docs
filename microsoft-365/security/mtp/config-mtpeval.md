Preparation is key to any successful deployment. In this article, you'll be guided on the points you'll need to consider as you prepare to deploy Microsoft Defender ATP.


## Microsoft Threat Protection pillars
Microsoft Threat Protection consists of four pillars. Although one pillar can already provide value to your network organization's security, enabling the four Microsoft Threat Protection pillars will give your organization the most value.

This section will guide you to configure:
-	Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection
-	Azure Advanced Threat Protection 
-	Microsoft Cloud App Security
-	Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection


## Configure Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection
>[!NOTE]
>Skip this step if you have already enabled Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. 

There is a PowerShell Module called the *Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA)* that helps determine some of these settings. When run as an administrator in your tenant, get-ORCAReport will help generate an assessment of the anti-spam, anti-phish, and other message hygiene settings. You can download this module from https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ORCA/. 

1. Navigate to [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/homepage) > **Threat management** > **Policy**. 
 
2. Click **ATP anti-phishing**, select **Create** and fill in the policy name and description. Click **Next**.  

>[!NOTE]
>Edit your Advanced ATP anti-phishing policy. Change **Advanced Phishing Threshold** to **2 - Aggressive**.
â€ƒ
3. Click the **Add a condition** drop-down menu and select your domain(s) as recipient domain. Click **Next**. 
 
4. Review your settings. Click **Create this policy** to confirm. 
 
5. Select **ATP Safe attachments** and select the **Turn on ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams** option.  

6. Click the + icon to create a new safe attachment policy, apply it as recipient domain to your domains. Click **Save**.
 
7. Next, select the **ATP Safe Links** policy, then click the pencil icon to edit the default policy.

8. Make sure that the **Do not track when users click safe links** option is not selected, while the rest of the options are selected. See [Safe Links settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365-atp?view=o365-worldwide) for details. Click **Save**. 

9. Next select the **Anti-malware** policy, select the default, and choose the pencil icon.

10. Click **Settings** and select **Yes and use the default notification text** to enable **Malware Detection Response**. Turn the **Common Attachment Types Filter** on. Click **Save**.
  
11. Navigate to [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/homepage) > **Search** > **Audit log search** and turn Auditing on.  

12. Integrate Office 365 ATP with Microsoft Defender ATP. Navigate to [Office 365 Security & Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/homepage) > **Threat management** > **Explorer** and select **WDATP Settings** on the upper right corner of the screen. In the Microsoft Defender ATP connection dialog box, turn on **Connect to Windows ATP**.

## Configure Azure Advanced Threat Protection
>[!NOTE]
>Skip this step if you have already enabled Azure Advanced Threat Protection. 

1. Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Security Center](https://security.microsoft.com/info) > select **More Resources** > **Azure Advanced Threat Protection**.

2. Click **Create** to start the Azure Advanced Threat Protection wizard. 

3. Choose **Provide a username and password to connect to your Active Directory forest**.  

4. Enter your Active Directory on-premises credentials. This can be any user account that has read access to Active Directory.
 
5. Next, choose **Download Sensor Setup** and transfer file to your domain controller. 

6. Execute the Azure ATP Sensor Setup and begin following the wizard.
 
7. Click **Next** at the sensor deployment type.
 
8. Copy the access key as you will need to enter it next in the Wizard.
 
9. Copy the access key into the Wizard and click **Install**. 

10. Congratulations, you have successfully configured Azure Advanced Threat Protection on your domain controller.
 
11. Under the [Azure Azure ATP](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2040449) settings section, select **Windows Defender ATP**, then turn the toggle on. Click **Save**.
