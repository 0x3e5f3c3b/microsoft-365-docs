# Microsoft Threat Protection data security and privacy

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection


Microsoft Threat Protection collects and stores information in a customer dedicated and segregated tenant specific to the service for administration, tracking, and reporting purposes.

When Microsoft Threat Protection is turned on, Microsoft may move your data between the services, where the data will be handled according to that service's data handling practices. In addition, any data stored specifically for the purpose of providing Microsoft Threat Protection service will be stored in:

- (a) the geo-location of the tenant as chosen during onboarding; and 
- (b) where Microsoft Threat Protection uses another Microsoft Online Service to process such data, it may store such data in accordance with the geo-location rules of that other Online service.

Customer data in pseudonymized form may also be stored in the central storage and processing systems in the United States.

Microsoft stores this data securely in Microsoft Azure and maintains it in accordance with Microsoft privacy practices and [Microsoft Trust Center policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=827578).
