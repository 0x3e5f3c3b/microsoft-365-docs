# Prioritize incidents in Microsoft Threat Protection

Microsoft Threat Protection applies correlation analytics and aggregates all related alerts and investigations from different products into one "incident" entity. By doing so, Microsoft Threat Protection narrates a broader attack story, allowing the SOC analyst to understand and deal with complex threats across the organization.


The **Incidents queue** shows a collection of incidents that were flagged from across devices, identities, and mailboxes. It helps you sort through incidents to prioritize and create an informed cybersecurity response decision.

By default, the queue in Microsoft 365 security center displays incidents seen in the last 30 days, with the most recent incident showing at the top of the list, helping you see the most recent incidents first.

Selecting an incident opens a side panel. It displays additional information about the incident, including all the related alerts. By default, the incident name is displayed as a serial number.

You can proceed to do further investigative work on an incident by pivoting to the incident page.
