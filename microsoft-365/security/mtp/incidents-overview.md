# Incidents overview in Microsoft Threat Protection


Incidents in Microsoft 365 tell the broader story of an attack by connecting the dots seen on individual alerts across entities. You'll know exactly where an attack started, what devices are impacted, who are affected, and where the threat has gone.


Malicious events on the following entities are surfaced in Microsoft 365 security center:
- Devices
- Identities
- Mailboxes

Suspicious events that are seen to show characteristics of being part of a larger attack are aggregated into an incident. 

The platform provides security defenders with the right visuals and data representations to understand and address complex cross-entity threats. 

Not only will you have visibility on the scope of an attack, but you'll also have access to services that will allow you to take tactical steps to contain an incident.
