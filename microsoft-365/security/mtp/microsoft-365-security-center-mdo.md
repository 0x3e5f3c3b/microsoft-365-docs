> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft 365 Security portal (https://security.microsoft.com) combines security features in https://securitycenter.windows.com, and https://protection.office.com. However, what you see will depend on your subscription. If you only have Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or 2, as standalone subscriptions, for example, you won't see capabilities around Security for Endpoints.

## Microsoft 365 security center Home page

The new Home page of the new portal surfaces:

- Secure Score ratings
- the number of users and devices at risk
- active incident lists
- lists of privileged OAuth apps
- device health data
- tweets from Microsoftâ€™s security intelligence twitter feed
- and more summary information

:::image type="content" source="../../media/1. Con.png" alt-text="When you arrive at https://security.microsoft.com, you'll see a welcome screen "Meet your improved security center" explaining that the center combines MDO and MDE in 1 place.":::

The Home page welcomes you to the new Microsoft 365 security center experience with three headings **Intro**, **Next steps**, and **Give feedback**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/2. conportal.png" alt-text="The main body of the center showing the Home page and links to Intro, Next steps, and to Give feedback.":::

- The links under **Next steps** will take you to the [Secure Score](https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=overview) page for deeper analysis of your security posture. Otherwise, clicking to [Proactively hunt](https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting) for intrusions will take you directly to Hunting > Advanced Hunting.
- **Give feedback** allows you to both [join the Windows Insider program](https://insider.windows.com/) and preview coming changes, and the **leave feedback** on your experiences with the portal.

The **Guided tour** will remain on the page and you can choose a tour of Endpoint or Email & collaboration pages.  

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-12-home-page-guided-tour-bar.png" alt-text="The security center's Home page with the Guided Tour selected shows you can tour Endpoint MSDE), or Email & Collaboration (MSDO).":::

Also included is a link to the **Office 365 Security and Compliance center** for comparison. The last link is to the **What's New** page that describes recent updates.

## New navigation

The left navigation, or quick launch bar, will look familiar. However, there are some new and updated elements in this security center.

### Alerts & Actions

Brings together incident and alert management across your email, devices, and identities. You can also hunt for security threats using hunting queries.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/3. ConPortal.png" alt-text="The Alerts and Actions quick launch on the left of the Microsoft 365 security center screen with menu options.":::

### Endpoints

View and manage the security of endpoints in your organization. If you've used the Microsoft Defender security center, this will look familiar.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-2-endpoints_new.png" alt-text="The quick launch menu for Endpoints (or MSDE) on the left hand side of the Microsoft 365 security center.":::

### Email & collaboration

## Advanced Hunting example for Microsoft Defender for Office 365
Want to get started searching for email threats using advanced hunting? Try this:

The [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp#getting-started) section of the [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 article](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp) has logical early configuration chunks that look like this:

- Configure everything with 'anti' in the name.
    - anti-malware
    - anti-phishing
    - anti-spam
- Set up everything with 'safe' in the name.
    - safe links
    - safe attachments
- Defend the workloads (ex. SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams)
- Protect with Zero-Hour auto purge

Along with a [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/protect-against-threats&preserve-view=true) to jump right in and get configuration going on Day 1.

The last step in **Getting Started** is protecting users with **Zero-Hour auto purge**, also known as ZAP. Knowing if your efforts to ZAP a suspicious or malicious mail, post-delivery, were successful can be very important.

Quickly navigating to Kusto query language to hunt for issues is an advantage of converging these two security centers. Security teams can monitor ZAP misses by taking their next steps [here](https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting), under **Hunting** > **Advanced Hunting**.

1. On the Advanced Hunting page, click Query.
1. Copy the query below into the query window.
1. Select Run query.


```kusto
EmailPostDeliveryEvents 
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
//List malicious emails that were not zapped successfully
| where ActionType has "ZAP" and ActionResult == "Error"
| project ZapTime = Timestamp, ActionType, NetworkMessageId , RecipientEmailAddress 
//Get logon activity of recipients using RecipientEmailAddress and AccountUpn
| join kind=inner IdentityLogonEvents on $left.RecipientEmailAddress == $right.AccountUpn
| where Timestamp between ((ZapTime-24h) .. (ZapTime+24h))
//Show only pertinent info, such as account name, the app or service, protocol, the target device, and type of logon
| project ZapTime, ActionType, NetworkMessageId , RecipientEmailAddress, AccountUpn, 
LogonTime = Timestamp, AccountDisplayName, Application, Protocol, DeviceName, LogonType
```

:::image type="content" source="../../media/converge-13-advanced-hunt-an-email-zap-new.png" alt-text="The Advanced hunting page (under Hunting)with Query selected at the top of the query panel, and running a Kusto query to capture ZAP actions over the last 7 days.":::

The data from this query will appear in the results panel below the query itself. Results include information like 'DeviceName', 'AccountDisplayName', and 'ZapTime' in a customizable result set. Results can also be exported for your records. If the query is one you'll need again, select **Save** > **Save As** and add the query to your list of queries, shared, or community queries.
