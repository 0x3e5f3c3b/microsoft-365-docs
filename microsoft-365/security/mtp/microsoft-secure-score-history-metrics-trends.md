# Microsoft Secure Score

Microsoft Secure Score is a measurement of an organization's security posture, with a higher number indicating more improvement actions taken. It can be found at https://security.microsoft.com/securescore in the [Microsoft 365 security center](overview-security-center.md).

Following the Secure Score recommendations can protect your organization from threats. From a centralized dashboard in the Microsoft 365 security center, organizations can monitor and work on the security of their Microsoft 365 identities, data, apps, devices, and infrastructure.

## Track your score history and meet goals

You can view a graph of your organization's score over time in the **History** tab. Below the graph is a list of all the actions taken in the selected time range and their attributes, such as resulting points and category. You can customize a date range and filter by category.

In the **Metrics & trends** tab, there are several graphs and charts to give you more visibility into trends and set goals. You can set the date range for the whole page of visualizations. The visualizations include:

* **Your Secure Score zone** — Customized based on your organization's goals and definitions of good, okay, and bad score ranges.
* **Regression trend** — A timeline of points that have regressed due to configuration, user, or device changes.  
* **Comparison trend** — How your organization's Secure Score compares to others' over time. This view can include lines representing the score average of organizations with similar seat count and a custom comparison view that you can set.
* **Risk acceptance trend** — Timeline of improvement actions marked as "risk accepted."
* **Score changes** — The number of points achieved, points regressed, along with the subsequent score change, in the specified date range.

## Risk awareness

Microsoft Secure Score is a numerical summary of your security posture based on system configurations, user behavior and other security related measurements; it is not an absolute measurement of how likely your system or data will be breached. Rather, it represents the extent to which you have adopted security controls in your Microsoft environment which can help offset the risk of being breached. No online service is completely immune from security breaches, and secure score should not be interpreted as a guarantee against security breach in any manner.
