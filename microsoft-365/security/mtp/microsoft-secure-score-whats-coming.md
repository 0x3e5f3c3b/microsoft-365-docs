# What's coming in Microsoft Secure Score?

To make Microsoft Secure Score a better representative of your security posture and improve usability, we are making some changes in the near future. Your score and the maximum possible score will change. However, this does not imply a change in your security posture.

To learn about recent changes, see [What's new in Microsoft Secure Score?](microsoft-secure-score.md#whats-new)

## April 21st 2020

- Apply Data Loss Prevention policies
