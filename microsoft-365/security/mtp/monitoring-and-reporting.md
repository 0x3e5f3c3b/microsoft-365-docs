The Microsoft 365 security center provides a summary of protection and security statuses across your Microsoft 365 environment.

The security center includes a **Reports** section which features a host of cards covering a variety of areas. Security analysts and administrators can track the cards as part of their day-to-day operations. On drill-down, cards provide detailed reports and, in some cases, management options.

Loosely, the cards fall into these categories:
  
- **Identities**- user accounts and credentials
    - Monitor the identities in your organization and keep track of suspicious or risky behaviors. [Learn more about identity protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection)
- **Data** - email and document contents
    - Help track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure.
- **Devices** - computers, mobile phones, and other devices
- **Apps** - programs and attached online services
    - These reports provide more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization. [Learn more about Cloud App Security discovered apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/discovered-apps)


Cards also contain topic such as:

* **Risk** - cards that highlight entities, such as accounts and devices, that might be at risk. These cards also highlight possible sources of risk, such as new threat campaigns and privileged cloud apps  
* **Detection trends** - cards that highlight new threat detections, anomalies, and policy violations
* **Configuration and health** - cards that cover the configuration and deployment of security controls, including device onboarding states to management services
* **Other** - all other cards not categorized under other topics
