The **Home** page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user role. Because the Microsoft 365 security center uses role-based access control, different roles will see cards that are more meaningful to their day to day jobs.  

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. The Microsoft 365 security center brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

Loosely, the cards fall into these categories:

- **Identities**- Monitor the identities in your organization and keep track of suspicious or risky behaviors. [Learn more about identity protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection)
- **Data** - Help track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure.
- **Devices** - Get up-to-date information on alerts, breach activity, and other threats on your devices.
- **Apps** - Gain insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization. [Learn more about Cloud App Security discovered apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/discovered-apps)
