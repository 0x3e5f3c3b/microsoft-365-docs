# The Action center in Microsoft Threat Protection

**Applies to**:
- Microsoft 365

In Microsoft Threat Protection, the Action center provides a view of current and past investigations across [Azure Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp), [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/automated-investigations), and [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-atp). This not only enables your security operations team to operate more effectively and efficiently, it also provides a more comprehensive view of Microsoft Threat Protection at work for your organization. 

You can get to the Action center by using one of several methods:
- While viewing information about an incident, choose the **Investigations** tab.
- In the Microsoft 365 security center, in the navigation pane, choose **Action center**. 

In the Action center, youâ€™ll see two tabs: **Pending** and **History**.
- The **Pending** tab lists investigations that require review and approval by someone in your security operations team to proceed. Make sure to review and take action on pending items you see here.
- The **History** tab lists past investigations as well as remediation actions that were taken automatically. You can view data for the past day, week, month, or six months.

To show only the columns you want to see, select **Customize columns**.
