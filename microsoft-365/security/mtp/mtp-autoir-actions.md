# Approve or reject pending actions following an automated investigation

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

When an automated investigation runs, it can result in one or more [remediation actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/mtp-remediation-actions) that require approval to proceed. For example, a cluster of email messages might need to be deleted, or a quarantined file might need to be removed. It's important to approve (or reject) pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations can proceed and complete in a timely manner. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must have [appropriate permissions](mtp-action-center.md#required-permissions-for-action-center-tasks) to approve or reject remediation actions. For more information, see [Prerequisites for automated investigation and response in Microsoft 365 Defender](mtp-configure-auto-investigation-response.md#prerequisites-for-automated-investigation-and-response-in-microsoft-365-defender).

In the improved Microsoft 365 security center, the Action center brings together pending and completed actions across your devices, email & collaboration content, and identities. This means that all remediation actions, whether they are completed or pending approval, or whether they are taken manually or automatically, are viewable in one portal: the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)).

Pending actions require approval before steps are taken to remediate detected entities. To review or approve pending actions, you can use either the [Pending tab in the Action center](#review-a-pending-action-in-the-action-center) or [while viewing the details of an investigation](#review-a-pending-action-in-the-investigation-details-view).

## Review a pending action in the Action center

## Undo completed actions

If youâ€™ve determined that a device or a file is not a threat, you can undo remediation actions that were taken, whether those actions were taken automatically or manually. In the Action center, on the **History** tab, you can undo any of the following actions:

### To undo a remediation action

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.

2. On the **History** tab, select an action that you want to undo.

3. In the pane on the right side of the screen, select **Undo**.

### To remove a file from quarantine across multiple devices 

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.

2. On the **History** tab, select a file that has the Action type **Quarantine file**.

3. In the pane on the right side of the screen, select **Apply to X more instances of this file**, and then select **Undo**.
