# Approve or reject pending actions following an automated investigation

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

When an automated investigation runs, it can result in one or more [remediation actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/mtp-remediation-actions) that require approval to proceed. For example, a cluster of email messages might need to be deleted, or a quarantined file might need to be removed. It's important to approve (or reject) pending actions as soon as possible so that your automated investigations can proceed and complete in a timely manner. 

In the new, unified Microsoft 365 security center, the Action center brings together pending and completed actions across
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint;
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365; and 
- Microsoft Defender for Identity

This means that all remediation actions, whether completed or pending approval, across your organization's devices, email & collaboration content, and identities, are viewable in one portal: the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)).

This article describes how to approve pending actions (these are actions that require approval before steps are taken to remediate detected entities). To review or approve pending actions, your security operations team can use either the [Pending tab in the Action center](#review-a-pending-action-in-the-action-center) or [while viewing the details of an investigation](#review-a-pending-action-in-the-investigation-details-view).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have [appropriate permissions](mtp-action-center.md#required-permissions-for-action-center-tasks) to approve or reject remediation actions. For more information, see [Prerequisites for automated investigation and response in Microsoft 365 Defender](mtp-configure-auto-investigation-response.md#prerequisites-for-automated-investigation-and-response-in-microsoft-365-defender).

## Review a pending action in the Action center

1. Go to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com) and sign in. 

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Action center**. 

3. In the Action Center, on the **Pending** tab, select an item in the list. 

    - If you select an item in the **Investigation number** column, the investigation details page opens. There, you can view the results of the investigation, and then either approve or reject the recommended action.
 
    - If you select a row in the list, a flyout opens, where you can view information about that item. <br/>![Approve or reject an action](../../media/air-actioncenter-itemselected.png)<br/>Use the links to view an associated alert or an investigation, and approve or reject the action.

## Undo completed actions

If youâ€™ve determined that a device or a file is not a threat, you can undo remediation actions that were taken, whether those actions were taken automatically or manually. In the Action center, on the **History** tab, you can undo any of the following actions:  

| Action source | Supported Actions |
|:---|:---|
| - Automated investigation <br/>- Microsoft Defender Antivirus <br/>- Manual response actions | - Isolate device <br/>- Restrict code execution <br/>- Quarantine a file <br/>- Remove a registry key <br/>- Stop a service <br/>- Disable a driver <br/>- Remove a scheduled task |

### To undo a remediation action

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.

2. On the **History** tab, select an action that you want to undo.

3. In the pane on the right side of the screen, select **Undo**.

### To remove a file from quarantine across multiple devices 

1. Go to the Action center ([https://security.microsoft.com/action-center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center)) and sign in.

2. On the **History** tab, select a file that has the Action type **Quarantine file**.

3. In the pane on the right side of the screen, select **Apply to X more instances of this file**, and then select **Undo**.
