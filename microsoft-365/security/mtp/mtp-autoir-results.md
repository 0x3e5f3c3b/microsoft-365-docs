## Remediation actions following automated investigation

When an automated investigation completes, a verdict is reached for every piece of evidence involved, and remediation actions are identified. In some cases, remediation actions are taken automatically; in other cases, remediation actions are pending approval. The following table lists possible verdicts and outcomes:

|Verdict	|Area	|Outcomes|
|------|------|------|
|Malicious	|Device (endpoints)<br/>Identity (user accounts)	|Remediation actions are taken automatically|
|Malicious	|Email content (URLs or attachments) | Recommended remediation actions are pending approval|
