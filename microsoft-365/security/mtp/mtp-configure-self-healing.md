# Configure self-healing capabilities in Microsoft Threat Protection

Microsoft Threat Protection includes power self-healing capabilities that can save your security operations team a lot of time and effort. Self-healing capabilities mimic the steps a security analyst would take to investigate and respond to threats, only faster and with more ability to scale. To learn more about self-healing, see [Self-healing in Microsoft Threat Protection](mtp-autoir.md).
