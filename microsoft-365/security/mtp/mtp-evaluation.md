# Create a Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab or pilot environment 

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft 365 Defender

The purpose of creating this trial lab or pilot environment is to illustrate the comprehensive and integrated Microsoft 365 Defender capabilities. Experience how this intelligent security solution detects, prevents, automatically investigates, and responds to advanced threats your organization. 

This guide takes you through the steps to start your Microsoft 365 Defender evaluation based on the recommended deployment paths. The goal is to help you set up the security solution either in a lab environment with a trial account, or in a pilot environment in production with a full license. Preparing your trial lab or pilot environment can help you present security operation use cases to decision makers in your organization. When youâ€™re done running your attack simulations and are satisfied with the results, you can fully deploy and operationalize it in your organization with the help of Microsoft Technical Sales Professionals or experts in your organization. 

This guide will help you:
- Set up your lab server and computers
- Configure Active Directory with users and groups
- Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Microsoft Cloud App Security
- Set up local policies for your server and computers
- Mimic a threat attack to generate a test incident or alert in Microsoft 365 Defender

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For optimum results, follow the lab setup instructions as closely as possible.


## Deployment phases

There are three phases in creating a Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab environment and deploying it:

|Phase | Description | 
|:-------|:-----|
| ![Phase 1: Prepare](../../media/prepare.png)<br>[Phase 1: Prepare](prepare-mtpeval.md)| Learn what you need to consider when deploying Microsoft 365 Defender in a trial lab or pilot environment: <br><br>- Stakeholders and sign-off <br> - Environment considerations <br>- Access <br>- Azure Active Directory setup <br> - Configuration order
|  ![Phase 2: Setup](../../media/setup.png) <br>[Phase 2: Setup](setup-mtpeval.md)|  Take the initial steps to access Microsoft 365 Security Center to set up your Microsoft 365 Defender trial lab or pilot environment. You'll be guided to:<br><br>- Sign up for Microsoft 365 E5 Trial <br>  - Configure domain<br>- Assign Microsoft 365 E5 licenses<br>- Complete the setup wizard in the portal|
|  ![Phase 3: Configure & Onboard](../../media/config-onboard.png) <br>[Phase 3: Configure & Onboard](config-mtpeval.md) | Configure each Microsoft 365 Defender pillar and onboard endpoints.
