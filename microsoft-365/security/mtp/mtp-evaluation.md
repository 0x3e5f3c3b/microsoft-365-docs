# Create a Microsoft Threat Protection trial lab or pilot environment 

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

The purpose of creating this trial lab or pilot environment is to illustrate the comprehensive, integrated, and intelligent capabilities of Microsoft Threat Protection in detection, prevention, investigation, and response that you can use in your organization. 

This guide takes you through the steps to start your Microsoft Threat Protection evaluation based on the recommended deployment paths. The goal is to help you set up the integrated Microsoft Threat Protection services in a lab environment when using a trial account, or in a pilot environment in production when using a full license. The results of which will be useful in presenting security operation use cases to security solution decision makers in your organization. When youâ€™re done running your attack simulations, and are satisfied with the results, you can fully deploy and operationalize it in your organization with the help of Microsoft Technical Sales Professionals or experts in your organization. 

This guide will help you:
- Set up your lab server and computers
- Configure Active Directory with users and groups
- Set up and configure Azure ATP, Office ATP, Microsoft Defender ATP, and Microsoft Cloud App Security
- Set up local policies for your server and computers
- Mimic a threat attack to generate a test incident or alert in Microsoft Threat Protection

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For optimum results, follow the lab setup instructions as closely as possible.


## Deployment phases

There are three phases in creating a Microsoft Threat Protection trial lab environment and deploying it:

|Phase | Description | 
|:-------|:-----|
| ![Phase 1: Prepare](../../media/prepare.png)<br>[Phase 1: Prepare](prepare-mtpeval.md)| Learn what you need to consider when deploying Microsoft Threat Protection in a trial lab or pilot environment: <br><br>- Stakeholders and sign-off <br> - Environment considerations <br>- Access <br>- Azure Active Directory setup <br> - Configuration order
|  ![Phase 2: Setup](../../media/setup.png) <br>[Phase 2: Setup](setup-mtpeval.md)|  Take the initial steps to access Microsoft 365 Security Center to set up your Microsoft Threat Protection trial lab or pilot environment. You'll be guided to:<br><br>- Sign up for Microsoft 365 E5 Trial <br>  - Configure domain<br>- Assign Microsoft 365 E5 licenses<br>- Complete the setup wizard in the portal|
|  ![Phase 3: Configure & Onboard](../../media/config-onboard.png) <br>[Phase 3: Configure & Onboard](config-mtpeval.md) | Configure each Microsoft Threat Protection pillar and onboard endpoints.
