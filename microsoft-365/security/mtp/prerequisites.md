# Microsoft Threat Protection prerequisites

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Threat Protection

[!INCLUDE[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

Learn about the licensing, hardware and software requirements, and other configuration settings to run and use the Microsoft 365 security.

## Licensing requirements
Microsoft 365 security requires one of the following licenses:

- Microsoft 365 E5 
- Office 365 E5, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, and Windows E5

You can acquire these licenses from the [Microsoft 365 enterprise page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise).

### Check your existing  licenses
Go to Microsoft 365 admin center at [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) to view your existing licenses. In the admin center, go to **Billing** > **Licenses**.

You need to be assigned either the **Billing admin** or **Global reader** [role in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles) to be able to see licensing information. If you encounter access problems, contact a global admin.  

## Browser requirements
Access to Microsoft 365 security center is done through a browser. Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge is supported. Any HTML5 compliant browsers are also supported.
