# Create and track ServiceNow tickets in the Microsoft 365 security center

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

>[!CAUTION]
>**The preview period for the ServiceNow connector has ended**<br>
>This capability is no longer available. Thank you for your feedback and continued support while we determine next steps.

The [Microsoft 365 security center](overview-security-center.md) has been enhanced with the ability to natively create and track tickets in ServiceNow. [Learn more about ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/)

In the security center, security administrators can send a [Microsoft Secure Score](microsoft-secure-score.md) improvement action directly to ServiceNow and create a ticket. Both incident management and change management tickets can be created. Track tickets in the security center home page and ServiceNow.
