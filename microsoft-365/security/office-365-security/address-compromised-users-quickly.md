# Address compromised user accounts with automated investigation and response

[Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2](office-365-atp.md#office-365-atp-plan-1-and-plan-2) includes powerful [automated investigation and response](office-365-air.md) capabilities. Recently, those capabilities were enhanced to include a compromised user security playbook (currently in preview). This enables your organization's security team to:
- Set sending limits on user accounts to limit the scope of a potential breach
- Identify compromised user accounts quickly through alerts and automated investigation
- Lock and investigate compromised user accounts
- Prevent (or severely limit) data theft and exfiltration
- Unblock user accounts following investigation and remediation

Read this article to learn more about the compromised user security playbook and how it can help your organization.
