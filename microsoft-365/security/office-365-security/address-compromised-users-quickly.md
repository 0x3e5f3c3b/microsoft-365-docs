# Address compromised user accounts with automated investigation and response

As you might already know, [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2](office-365-atp.md#office-365-atp-plan-1-and-plan-2) includes powerful [automated investigation and response](office-365-air.md) capabilities. These capabilities can save your security operations team a lot of time and effort dealing with threats. Recently, those capabilities were enhanced to include a compromised user security playbook (currently in preview). 

The compromised user security playbook enables your organization's security team to:
- Speed up detection of compromised user accounts;
- Limit the scope of a breach when an account is compromised; and 
- Respond to compromised users more effectively and efficiently.

## Compromised user alerts

## Investigate and respond to a compromised user

## Keep the following points in mind

- The longer a compromise goes undetected, the larger the potential for widespread impact and cost to your organization, customers, and partners. Early detection and response is critical.
- Automated investigation and response capabilities can detect a compromised user, but your security operations team will likely need to do some investigation and remediation as well.
- When a user account is compromised, it might not trigger a suspicious login alert.
