# View pending or completed remediation actions following an automated investigation in Office 365

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]



![AIR investigations action page](../../media/air-investigationactionspage.png)

## Approve (or reject) pending actions

While viewing the [details of an investigation](air-view-investigation-results.md), you can approve or reject any pending remediation actions. We recommend doing this as soon as possible so that your automated investigations complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Appropriate permissions are required to approve or reject remediation actions. See [Required permissions to use AIR capabilities](office-365-air.md#required-permissions-to-use-air-capabilities).

1. Go to <https://protection.office.com> and sign in. This takes you to the the Security & Compliance Center.

2. Go to **Threat management** \> **Investigations**.

3. In the list of investigations, select an item in the **ID** column.

4. Select the **Actions** tab.

5. Select an item in the list. (This activates the Approve and Reject buttons.)

6. Review available information for the item(s) you selected, and then either approve or reject the action(s).
   - **Approve** allows remediation to begin.
   - **Reject** takes no further action
