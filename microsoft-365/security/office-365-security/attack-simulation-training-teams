In organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft 365 Defender, admins can now use Attack simulation training to deliver simulated phishing messages in Microsoft Teams. For more information about attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

## Simulations using Microsoft Teams messages

The addition of Microsoft Teams in Attack simulation training introduces the following changes to Simulations as described in [Simulate a phishing attack with Attack simulation training in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md):

- On the **Simulations** tab of the **Attack simulation training** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>, the **Platform** column shows the value **Teams** for simulations that were delivered using Microsoft Teams.

- After you select ![Launch a simulation icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Launch a simulation**, the first screen of the wizard is now **Select delivery platform** where you can select **Microsoft Teams**. Selecting **Microsoft Teams** introduces the following changes to the rest of the simulation wizard:
  - On the **[Select technique](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique)** page, the **Malware Attachment** and **Link in Attachment** social engineering techniques are not available.
  - On the **[Name simulation](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#name-and-describe-the-simulation)** page, a **Select sender's Microsoft Teams account** section and **Select user account** link are present. Click **Select user account** to find and select the account that's used as the source for the Microsoft Teams message in the flyout that opens.
  - The **[Select payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page)** page shows any available payloads that apply to Microsoft Teams and the previously selected social engineering technique. When you click ![Create a payload icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Create a payload**, the differences for Microsoft Teams are described in the Payloads in Microsoft teams section in this article.
  - The **[Target users](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#target-users)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
  - The **Exclude users** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
  - The **[Assign training](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#training-assignment)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.

    If you select **Microsoft training experience** and **Select training courses and modules myself**, the **Training assignment** that becomes the next page in the wizard shows any available trainings that apply to Microsoft Teams and the previously selected social engineering technique. When you click ![Add trainings icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png) **Add trainings**, the differences for Microsoft Teams are described in the Trainings in Microsoft teams section in this article.

  - The **[Select phish landing page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#landing-page)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
  - The **[Select end user notification](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-end-user-notification)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
  - The **[Launch details](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#launch-details)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
  - The **[Review simulation](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#launch-details)** page is unchanged by Microsoft Teams.
