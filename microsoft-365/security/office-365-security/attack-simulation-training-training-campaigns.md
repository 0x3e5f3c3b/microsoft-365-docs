# Training campaigns in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

**Applies to**
 [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 2](defender-for-office-365.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes features that are in Public Preview, aren't available in all organizations, and are subject to change.

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, Training campaigns are a faster, more direct way to provide security training to users. Instead of creating and launching [simulated phishing attacks](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md) that eventually lead to training, you can create and assign Training campaigns directly to users.

A Training campaign contains one or more built-in Training modules that you select. Currently, there are over 70 Training modules to select from. For more information about Training modules, see [Training modules for Training campaigns in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-training-modules.md).

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the existing Training campaigns, open the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. To go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

The **Training campaigns** tab lists the Training campaigns that you've created. The list includes the following information for each Training campaign<sup>\*</sup>:

- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Duration (mins)**
- **Date of completion**
- **Training completion**: The number of users who were included in the Training campaign and how many of them completed the training. The information is shown as a fraction (for example, **2/5**) and in a corresponding horizontal bar graph.
- **No. of training modules**: The number of training modules that are included in the Training campaign.
- **Created by**
- **Created time**
- **Status**: One of the following values:
  - **Completed**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **In progress**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Draft**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Canceled**
  - **Deleted**
  - **Failed**<sup>\*\*</sup>
  - **Scheduled**<sup>\*\*</sup>

  For more information about the **Status** values, see [Set the training threshold time period](#set-the-training-threshold-time-period).

- **â‹®** (**Actions** control): Take action on the Training campaign. The available actions depend on the **Status** value of the Training campaign as described in the procedure sections. This control always appears at the end of the Training campaign row.

Click a column header to sort by that column. To add or remove columns, click ![Customize columns icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png) **Customize columns**. By default, all available columns are selected.

<sup>\*</sup> To see all columns, you likely need to do one or more of the following steps:

- Horizontally scroll in your web browser.
- Narrow the width of appropriate columns.
- Remove columns from the view.
- Zoom out in your web browser.

Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Filter** to filter the information on the page by the **Status** value of the Training campaign.

<sup>\*\*</sup> The total count of Training campaigns with these **Status** values is also shown at the top of the page. But if you filter the information (for example, exclude on of these **Status** values), the count at the top of the page will be **0** for that excluded **Status** value.

To find a Training campaign in the list, type part of the campaign name in the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png"::: **Search** box and then press the ENTER key.

To see details about a Training campaign, see the [View Training campaign details](#view-training-campaign-details) section.

## Create Training campaigns

To create a Training campaign, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Training** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Training** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>.

2. On the **Training** tab,select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png"::: **Create new** to start the new Training campaign wizard.

   The following sections describe the steps and configuration options to create a Training campaign.

   > [!NOTE]
   > At any point after you name the Training campaign during the new Training campaign wizard, you can click **Save and close** to save your progress and continue later. The incomplete Training campaign has the **Status** value **Draft**. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the Training campaign and then clicking the ![Edit icon.](../../media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png) **Edit** icon that appears.

      - Type three or more characters and then press the ENTER key. Any users or group names that contain those characters are shown in the **User list** section by **Name** and **Email**.
      - Type fewer than three characters or no characters and then press the ENTER key. No users are shown in the **User list** section, but you can type three or more characters in the **Search** box to search for users and groups.

        - **Repeat offenders**: For more information, see [Configure the repeat offender threshold](attack-simulation-training-settings.md#configure-the-repeat-offender-threshold).

      The number of values that were used as the search criteria by a specific category is shown next to the category tile (for example, **Suggested user groups (2)**).

      When you're finished searching by category, click the **Apply(x)** button. The previous **Filter users by categories** options on the **Add users** flyout are replaced by the following information:

## Set the training threshold time period

The training threshold time period is the number of days for which a training module won't be re-assigned to a user who meets either of the following criteria:

- They already completed the same training module during the threshold time period.
- They're actively assigned the same training module during the threshold time period.

The training threshold starts from the time of user training module assignment.

We recommend the number of days for the training threshold assignment to be greater than the number of days that a user would have to complete a training module assignment.

In the training campaign user report, a user may have the following **Status** values:

- **Completed**: The user has already completed their training module.
- **In Progress**: The user has started their training module.
- **Not Started**: The user hasn't started their training module.
- **Training Already Completed**: The user was previously assigned and completed the training module within the training threshold time period.
- **Training Previously Assigned**: The user currently has been assigned the training module within the training threshold time period, but hasn't completed the training. The user can still complete the training module to move it to a **Completed** state.
- **Overdue**: The user hasn't completed the training before the assigned module due date and hasn't been reassigned the same training module within the training threshold period.
- **Not Completed**: The user hasn't completed the training module within the assigned module due date and/or is outside the training threshold period and is eligible for the same training module reassignment.

You set the training threshold on the **Settings** tab on the **Attack simulation training** page. For more information about the **Settings** tab, see [Global settings in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-settings.md).

To set the training threshold on the **Settings** tab, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Settings** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Settings** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=setting>.

2. Set the value in days for the training threshold time period. The default value is 90 days. To remove the training threshold and always assign training, set value to 0.

3. When you're finished, click **Save**.
