# Simulate a phishing attack

Attack simulator training through Microsoft Defender for Office 365 lets you run benign cyber attack simulations on your organization to test your security policies and practices, as well as train the employees of your organization to increase their awareness and decrease their susceptibility to attacks. The following walks you through simulating a phishing attack using attack simulator training.

[!INCLUDE [Prerelease information](../includes/prerelease.md)]

To launch a simulated phishing attack, navigate to the [Microsoft 365 security center](https://security.microsoft.com/). Under **Email & collaboration** click on **Attack simulator** and switch to the [**Simulations**](https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations) tab.

Under **Simulations** select **+ Launch a simulation**.

> [!NOTE]
> At any point during simulation creation you can save and close to continue configuring the simulation at a later time.

## Selecting a social engineering technique

Select from 4 different techniques, curated from the [MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/). Different payloads are available for different techniques.

- **Credential harvest** attempts to collect credentials from employees by taking them to a well-known looking website with input boxes to submit a username and password.
- **Malware attachment** adds a malicious attachment to a message. When opened, this attachment will run some arbitrary code that will help the attacker compromise the target's device.
- **Link in attachment** is a type of credential harvest hybrid. An attacker inserts a URL into an email attachment. The URL within the attachment follows the same technique as credential harvest.
- **Link to malware** will run some arbitrary code from a file hosted on a well-known file-sharing site. A link to this malicious file is added to the message sent to the target and clicking it will run the file and help the attacker compromise the target's device.

> [!TIP]
> Clicking on **View details** within the description of each technique will display further information about the technique as well as the simulation steps for that technique.

Once you've selected the technique and clicked on **Next** give your simulation a name and optionally a description.

## Selecting a payload

Next, you'll need to either select a payload from the pre-existing payload catalog.

Payloads have a number of data points to help you choose:

- **Click rate** counts how many people clicked this payload.
- **Predicted compromise rate** predicts the percentage of people that will get compromised by this payload based on historic data for this payload across Microsoft Defender for Office 365 customers.
- **Simulations launched** counts the number of times this payload was used in other simulations.
- **Complexity**, available through **filters**, is calculated based on the number of indicators within the payload that clue targets in on it being an attack. More indicators lead to lower complexity.
- **Source**, available through **filters**, indicates whether the payload was created on your tenant or is a part of Microsoft's pre-existing payload catalog (global).

Select a payload from the list to see a preview of the payload with additional information about it.

If you'd like to create your own payload, read [create a payload for attack simulation training]().

Once you've selected your payload and clicked **Next**, you'll need to target users for this simulation.
You can choose to **include all users in your organization** or **include only specific users and groups**. If you include only specific users and groups, besides your ability to search by clicking on **Add users** you can also import a list from a CSV file by clicking on **Import**.

## Assigning training

We recommend that you assign training for each simulation, as employees who go through training are less susceptible to similar attacks.

You can either choose to have training assigned for you or select training courses and modules yourself.

Select the **training due date** to make sure employees finish their training in a timely manner.

> [!NOTE}
> If you choose to select courses and modules yourself, you'll still be able to see the recommended content as well as all available courses and modules.

In the next steps you'll need to **Add trainings** if you opted to select it yourself, and customize your training landing page. You'll be able to preview the training landing page, as well as change the header and body of it.

## Launch details and review

Now that everything is configured, you can launch this simulation immediately or schedule it for a later date. You will also need to choose when to end this simulation. We will stop capturing interaction with this simulation past the selected time. 

**Enable region aware timezone delivery** to deliver simulated attack messages to your employees during their working hours based on their region.

Once you're done, click on **Next** and review the details of your simulation. Click on **Edit** on any of the parts to go back and change any details that need changing. Once done, click **Submit**.
