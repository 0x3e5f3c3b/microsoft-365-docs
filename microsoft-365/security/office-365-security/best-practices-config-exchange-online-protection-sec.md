# Best-practices for configuring EOP and Office 365 ATP security

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for E3 Office 365 subscriptions. It's optional, and even encouraged, for E3 customers to buy a subscription to **Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**, ex. ATP Plan 1 or ATP Plan 2, in order to leverage the added security available in E5 Office 365 subscriptions.

We'll discuss two security levels, called Recommended and Aggressive in EOP, covering comments on how to use features at both levels of security. The sections begin with email validation and authentication, which involves some tinkering outside of Office 365, in DNS, and secures outbound mail, making tenants good citizens to the resources they mail. These settings best protect your subscription.

## Email authentication

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are acronyms for Sender Policy Framework, DomainKeys Identified Mail, and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (quite a mouthful), and are the basis of email authentication and validation.

These methods handle outbound email from Office 365, and help destination systems trust that email from your domain is valid. They're the only best practices we'll be covering that involve configurations to be made *outside* of Office 365, in your DNS. For specific configuration steps, see the [Email validation and authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/how-office-365-uses-spf-to-prevent-spoofing) section in the Security and Compliance table of contents.

|Security feature name|Recommended|Aggressive|Comment|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Create SPF records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing)    | Yes        |    Yes     |   -      |
|[Configure DKIM Signing for Domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email)     |  Yes       |    Yes     |  -       |
|[Implement DMARC with reject or quarantine action](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/use-dmarc-to-validate-email)     |   Yes      |     Yes    |   Use action=quarantine for Recommended, and action=reject for Aggressive.     |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To work with security roles and permissions, be sure you have the right role or roles in Office 365 or the Security and Compliance Center. If you are a *Security Administrator* in Azure Active Directory, a *Global Administrator* in Office 365, or an *Exchange Online Organizational Manager* in Exchange Online/Exchange Online Powershell, you're ready to go.

## Anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing

Both anti-spam and anti-malware are features of EOP. Spam filtering, on by default in Office 365, scans all mail and assigns a Spam Confidence Level (SCL) number value to each mail. Just to clarify, its purpose is to enumerate how confident the filter is that the mail is (or isn't) spam. Low values, like -1, 0, 1 are whitelisted or non-spam messages that land in a user Inbox. High score, like  9 is either highly suspect, or known spammers and heads for a user's Junk Mail, or administrator-accessible Quarantine.

Malware filtering is also on by default in Office 365. Like anti-spam filtering, anti-malware filters work on both inbound and outbound mail. In both cases this protection can be configured for a better fit, by admins.

Phishing filters are on by default in Office 365, but should be configured for a better fit. Here's what we would recommend for Anti-Phishing in EOP.

### Anti-Spam policy

## Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) security

Earlier, I said that it was encouraged for E3 subscriptions to add an Office 365 ATP plan 1, or the more fully-realized ATP Plan 2. Advanced Anti-phishing is one reason why. Enabled by default, anti-phishing ***must*** be configured with policies to operate. Forgetting to configure anti-phishing policies exposes users to risk, be sure that's step-2 after you add an ATP subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an E5 subscription, you currently have [ATP Plan 2](https://products.office.com/exchange/advance-threat-protection). Check this link when you want to find out [what's new in ATP](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/whats-new-in-office-365-atp?branch=oatp-newstuff).

### Advanced Anti-phishing

Phishing is an attempt to masquerade as reputable company or person for the purpose of stealing personal information like credit-card numbers, or computer or device pins or passwords. Phishing can involve:

- **Spoofing**, where spoofers try to send mail on behalf of a specific target in a domain (for example, ellar@2020contoso.com trying to send mail for ellar@2020litware.com (a scenario email authentication methods can help thwart).

- **Impersonation**, where mail is received whose sender is visually similar (or look-alike) to a target domain or username. The bad actor here, mimics a specific username, or pretends to be sending mail from a target domain. Here's a pretense domain: ellar@2020|itware.com, and here's a pretense user: ellÎ±r@2020litware.com (look closely at the domain and user names in these examples to catch the domain and user impersonation).

If you've added an Office 365 ATP subscription to your EOP, be sure to set the following configurations.

|Security feature name|Recommended|Aggressive|Comment|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Advanced phishing thresholds | 2 | 4 | - |
|Enable Anti-impersonation protection | Yes | Yes | - |
|Enable Mailbox intelligence in Anti-Impersonation policies | Yes | Yes | - |
|Enable Mailbox intelligence based Impersonation protection | Yes | Yes | - |
|Domain Impersonation action should be | MoveToJmf | Quarantine | - |
|User Impersonation action should be | MoveToJmf | Qurantine | - |
|Mailbox intelligence based impersonation protection action should be | No Action + Safety Tip  | MoveToJmf | - |


### Safe Links and Safe Attachments

 ATP includes the Safe Attachment and Safe Links policies to prevent email with potentially malicious attachments from being delivered, and to keep users from clicking and traveling to potentially unsafe URLs.

| ATP Safe Links should not let users click through safe links to original URL | Disabled | Enabled | - |
<!--
|URLs to block | | | |
|URLs not to wrap | | | |-->

#### Safe Attachments
