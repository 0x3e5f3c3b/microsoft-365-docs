# Best-practices for EOP and Office 365 ATP security

**Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** is the core of security for E3 Office 365 subscriptions and helps keep malicious emails from reaching your employee's inboxes. But with new, more sophisticated attacks emerging every day, improved protections are a necessity. While it's optional, there are additional security features in **Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** ATP Plan 1 or ATP Plan 2, that provide more layers of security, control, and investigation. 

There are two security levels in EOP and Office365 ATP: **Standard** and **Strict**. These define different levels of mail filtering configurations that help prevent unwanted mail from reaching your employees inbox. 

This topic contains Microsoft recommeded settings to help protect your Office 365 users.

## Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) security
Additional security benefits come with an Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection subscription. For the latest news and information, you can see [What's new in Office 365 ATP](whats-new-in-office-365-atp.md). 


### Advanced Anti-phishing
Phishing is an attempt to masquerade as reputable company or person for the purpose of stealing personal information like credit-card numbers, or computer or device pins or passwords. Phishing can involve:

- **Spoofing**, where spoofers try to send mail on behalf of a specific target in a domain (for example, ellar@2020contoso.com trying to send mail for ellar@2020litware.com (a scenario email authentication methods can help thwart).

- **Impersonation**, where mail is received whose sender is visually similar (or look-alike) to a target domain or username. The bad actor here, mimics a specific username, or pretends to be sending mail from a target domain. Here's a pretense domain: ellar@2020|itware.com, and here's a pretense user: ellÎ±r@2020litware.com (look closely at the domain and user names in these examples to catch the domain and user impersonation).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Advanced Anti-phishing is one of the benefits of an Office 365 ATP subscription. Enabled by default, anti-phishing ***must*** be configured by using policies before it'll start filtering mail. Forgetting to configure anti-phishing policies could exposes users to risky emails. Make sure to configure your Anti-phishing policies after you add an Office 365 ATP subscription.

If you've added an Office 365 ATP subscription to your EOP, set the following configurations.

|Security feature name|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Advanced phishing threshold|2|3||
|Enable Anti-impersonation protection|Yes|Yes||
|Enable Mailbox intelligence in Anti-Impersonation policies|Yes|Yes||
|Enable Mailbox intelligence based Impersonation protection|Yes|Yes||
|Domain Impersonation action should be|MoveToJmf|Quarantine||
|User Impersonation action should be|MoveToJmf|Quarantine||
|Mailbox intelligence based impersonation protection action should be|No Action + Safety Tip|MoveToJmf||

### Safe Links and Safe Attachments

Office 365 ATP includes the Safe Attachment and Safe Links policies to prevent email with potentially malicious attachments from being delivered, and to keep users from clicking potentially unsafe URLs.

#### Safe Links settings

|Security feature name|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

|ATP Safe Links action for unknown potentially malicious URLs in messages|On|On||

## Email Authentication

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are acronyms for Sender Policy Framework, DomainKeys Identified Mail, and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (quite a mouthful), and are the basis of email authentication and validation.

These methods handle outbound email from Office 365, and help destination systems trust that email from your domain is valid. These  configurations are made *outside* of Office 365, in your DNS. For specific configuration steps, see the [How Office 365 uses Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to prevent spoofing](how-office-365-uses-spf-to-prevent-spoofing.md) section in the Security and Compliance table of contents.

|Security feature name|Standard|Strict|Comment|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Set up SPF in Office 365 to help prevent spoofing](set-up-spf-in-office-365-to-help-prevent-spoofing.md)|Yes|Yes||
|[Use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain in Office 365](use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email.md)|Yes|Yes||
|[Use DMARC to validate email in Office 365](use-dmarc-to-validate-email.md)|Yes|Yes|Use action=none for Recommended, and action=reject for Aggressive.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To work with security roles and permissions, be sure you have the right role or roles in Office 365 or the Security and Compliance Center. If you are a *Security Administrator* in Azure Active Directory, a *Global Administrator* in Office 365, or an *Exchange Online Organizational Manager* in Exchange Online/Exchange Online Powershell, you're ready to go.
