# Configuration best-practices for EOP security

Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is the primary source of security for E3 Office 365 subscriptions. It's optional, and even encouraged, for E3 customers to buy a subscription to Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), ex. ATP Plan 2, in order to leverage the depth of security available in E5 Office 365 subscriptions.
