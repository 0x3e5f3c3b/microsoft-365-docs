# Campaigns in Office 365 ATP

Campaigns is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) in Office 365 that identifies and categorizes phishing attacks that are detected in in the service. Campaigns can help you to:

- Efficiently investigate and respond to phishing attacks.

- Better understand the scope of the attack.

- Show value to decision makers.

Campaigns lets you see the big picture of an attack faster and more complete than any human.

## What is a campaign?

A campaign is a coordinated email attack against one or many organizations. Today, email attacks that steal credentials and company data are a big and lucrative business. As technologies increase in an effort to stop attacks, attackers are sophisticated enough to modify their methods in an effort to ensure continued success.

Campaigns leverage the vast amounts of anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware data and experience across the entire Office 365 service world-wide. The attack information is analyzed and classified according to several factors. For example:

- **Attack source**: Source IP addresses and sender email domains.

- **Attack message properties**: The content, style, and tone of the attack messages.

- **Attack recipients**: Recipient domains, recipient job functions (admins, executives, etc.), company types (large, small, public, private, etc.), and industries.

- **Attack payload**: Malicious links, attachments, or other payloads.

## Campaigns in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center

Campaigns is located in the [Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/go-to-the-securitycompliance-center).
