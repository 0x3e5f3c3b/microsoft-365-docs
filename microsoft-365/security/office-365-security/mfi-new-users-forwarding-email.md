# New users forwarding email insight in the Security & Compliance Center

It's suspicious when new user accounts in your organization suddenly start forwarding email messages to external domains.

The **New domains being forwarded email** insight in the Security & Compliance Center notifies you when newly-created users in your organization are forwarding messages to external domains.

This insight appears only when the issue is detected, and it appears on the [Forwarding report](view-mail-flow-reports.md#forwarding-report) page.

When you click on the widget, a flyout appears where you can find more details about the forwarded messages, including a link to the [Forwarding modifications report](view-mail-flow-reports.md#forwarding-modifications-report).

If you suspect the accounts have been compromised, see [Responding to a compromised email account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/responding-to-a-compromised-email-account).
