# Changes in automated investigation and response capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

If you’ve been using [automated investigation and response ](office-365-air.md)(AIR) capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you’ll notice a few changes in the [new and improved Microsoft 365 security center](microsoft-365-security-center-getting-started.md). The security center brings together AIR capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 together with [AIR in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/automated-investigations). With these updates and improvements, you’ll be able to view details about automated investigations and remediation actions across your email and devices in one place.

> [!TIP]
> The Microsoft 365 security center ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) replaces the following centers:
> - Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com))
> - Microsoft Defender Security Center ([https://securitycenter.windows.com](https://securitycenter.windows.com))

In addition to the URL changing, there’s a new look and feel, designed to give your security team a more streamlined experience.
