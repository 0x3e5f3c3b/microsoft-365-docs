# The Microsoft 365 Security center dashboard for Email & Collaboration

The way you access Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MSDO, but formerly known as Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection or ATP) has changed. The layout of the portal has been simplified and combined with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (or Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, MDATP).

In short, the new [Microsoft 365 Security portal](https://security.microsoft.com/) combines:

1. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MSDO)
2. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MSDE)

in one easy to navigate location. This means security for your Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription, and for the devices that connect to it, are done from one portal.

> [!NOTE]
> If you know MSDO (once Office 365 ATP) from  the core overview article ‘[Office 365 Security overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/?view=o365-worldwide)’, then you're aware much of the Microsoft documentation about MSDO can be roughly broken down in Security Administrator and Security Operations topics. <p>The Microsoft 365 Security center has the same strengths. Many of the administration topics appear under ‘Policies & Rules’, and ‘[Dashboard](https://security.microsoft.com/alertsdashboard)’. Long term security investigation, detection, defense, and response as per Security Operations, takes place in the other sections of the Email & Collaboration section.

If you need more detailed information on the combination of these security centers, see Getting started with the Microsoft 365 Security center for security admins and operations teams.

## The Email & Collaboration (E&C) dashboard in Microsoft 365 Security center

To reach the Email & Collaboration dashboard, use the URL: https://security.microsoft.com/alertsdashboard.

The E&C dashboard is driven by **Incidents and Alerts** > **Email and collaboration alerts** at the time of writing.

The new dashboard will show Alert trends for Email & Collaborations, Active alerts by severity (including Data loss, Threat management, and other alert types), your most recent alerts by severity and policy, and give you a panel for viewing and creating Alert policies.
