# Office 365 Security

When you get your Office 365 suite, it may not be immediately clear what features you've bought, or where they all are in your subscription. There's more to it than can be seen by browsing Billing > Your Products in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/#/homepage). The aim of this article is to introduce you to your new security properties in the Cloud. Let's get started.

# Office 365 Security layers

When you subscribe to Office 365, there are security options you get immediately, by default. **[Exchange Online Protection (EOP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/exchange-online-protection-overview?view=o365-worldwide)** is included in every Office 365 organization with *Exchange Online mailboxes*. However, features in **Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** come highly recommended for your increased security. ATP comes in two flavours -- **Plan 1**, and **Plan 2** -- and, once bought, as the name suggests, will broaden your organization's security reach.

EOP and ATP work together.

> [!NOTE]
> For complete security options, choose ATP Plan 2.
