## Learn more on Restricted entities

A restricted entity is an entity that has been blocked from sending email because either it has been potentially compromised, or it has exceeded sending limit.

There are 2 types of restricted entities: 

- **Restricted user**: For more information about why a user can be restricted and how to handle restricted users, see [Remove blocked users from the Restricted entities portal](removing-user-from-restricted-users-portal-after-spam.md). 

- **Restricted connector**: For more information about why a connector can be restricted and how to handle restricted connectors, see [Remove blocked connectors from the Restricted entities portal](remove-blocked-connectors.md).
