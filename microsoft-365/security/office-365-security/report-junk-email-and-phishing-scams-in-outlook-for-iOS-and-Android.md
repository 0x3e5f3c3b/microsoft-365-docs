# Report junk and phishing email in Outlook for iOS and Android

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or on-premises mailboxes leveraging hybrid modern authentication, you can use the built-in reporting options in Outlook for iOS and Android to submit false positives (good email marked as spam), false negatives (bad email allowed) and phishing messages to Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- If you're an admin in an organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

- You can configure reported messages to be copied or redirected to a mailbox that you specify. For more information, see [Specify a mailbox for user submissions of spam and phishing messages in Exchange Online](user-submission.md).

- For more information about reporting messages to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).
