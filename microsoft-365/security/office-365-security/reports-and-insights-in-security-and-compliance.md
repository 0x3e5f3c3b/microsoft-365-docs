## Smart reports and insights overview

Monitoring capabilities available in the Security & Compliance Center include smart reports and insights that enable your compliance and security admins to focus on high-priority issues, such as security attacks or increased suspicious activity. In a dashboard, smart reports and insights resemble the following image:

In addition to highlighting problem areas, smart reports and insights include recommendations and links to view and explore data and also take quick actions. For example, if your organization suddenly has a high number of email messages being marked as spam by end users, you might be advised to revisit your anti-spam policies to ensure the right level of protection is in place.

A wide variety of reports are available. (Go to **Reports** \> **Security report** to get an all-up view).
