# Getting security value from Microsoft Defender for Office 365 when you have 3rd party email filtering

If you’re licensed for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and host your mailboxes within Office 365 but are using a 3rd party for your email security - this guide is for you to get the most out of your investment, broken down into easy to follow stages.

## What you will need
-	Mailboxes hosted within Office 365
-	Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 for protection features
-	Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 for most other features (included in E5 plans)
-	Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Trial (available to all customers at aka.ms/tryMDO)
-	Sufficient permissions for the tools listed below


## Step 1 – Understand the value you already have

### Protection features

-	Built in protection offers a base level of unintrusive protection, which includes malware, zero day (Safe Attachments) and URL protection (Safe Links) within email (including internal email), SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. Note that URL protection provided in this state is via API call only.  It does not wrap or rewrite URLs but does require a supported Outlook client – you can create your own custom policies to expand your protection.

**Read more & watch an overview video of Safe Links here :** [Complete Safe Links overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-links)

**Read more about Safe Attachments here :**  [Safe Attachments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/safe-attachments)

### Detection, investigation, response and hunting features

-	When alerts fire within Microsoft Defender for Office 365, they are automatically correlated and combined into Incidents, to help reduce the alert fatigue on security staff. Automated Investigation and Response (AIR) will have triggered investigations to help remediate and contain threats.

**Read more, watch an overview video and get started here :** [Incident response with Microsoft 365 Defender | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/incidents-overview)

-	Threat Analytics is our in-product detailed threat intelligence solution from expert Microsoft security researchers, detailed reports designed to get you up to speed on the latest threat actors, attack techniques, how to protect your organization with IOCs and much more.

**Read more, watch an overview video and get started here :** [Threat analytics in Microsoft 365 Defender | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/threat-analytics)

-	Explorer can be used to hunt threats, visualize mail flow patterns, spot trends, and identify the impact of changes you make during the tuning of Defender for Office 365. You can also quickly delete messages from your organization with a few simple clicks

## Step 2 – Enhance the value further with these simple steps

### Protection features

-	Consider enabling policies beyond Built in Protection, enabling time of click protection, or impersonation protection for example to add additional layers or fill gaps missing from your 3rd party protection. Note if you have a transport rule or connection filter currently overriding verdicts (known sometimes as SCL-1) you will need to address this before turning on additional protection features.

-	If your current security provider is configured to modify messages in any way, it’s important to note that authentication signals can impact the ability for Defender for Office to protect you against attacks such as spoofing. If your 3rd party supports Authenticated Received Chain (ARC), then enabling this is a highly recommended step in your journey to advanced dual filtering. Moving any message modification configuration to Defender for Office 365 is also an alternative.

-	Enhanced Filtering for connectors allows IP address and sender information to be preserved through the 3rd party. This improves accuracy for the filtering (protection) stack, post breach capabilities & authentication improvements. Enhanced filtering for connectors in Exchange Online | Microsoft Docs

-	Priority account protection will offer enhanced visibility for accounts in tooling, along with additional protection when in an advanced defense in depth configuration state.

-	Advanced Delivery should be configured to deliver any 3rd party phish simulations correctly, and if you have a Security Operations mailbox, consider defining it as a SecOps mailbox to ensure emails do not get removed from the mailbox due to threats.

**Read more here:** [Advanced delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/configure-advanced-delivery)

-	User-reported email settings can be configured to allow users to report messages, directly to Microsoft, to your custom mailbox (to integrate with current security workflows) or both, the submissions portal can also be access to triage false positives and negatives.

### Detection, investigation, response and hunting features

-	Advanced hunting can be used to proactively hunt for threats in your organization, using shared queries from the community to help you get started. You can also utilize custom detections to set up alerts when personalized criteria are met.

**Read more, watch an overview video and get started here:** [Overview - Advanced hunting | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview)

### Education features

- Attack simulation training allows you to run realistic but benign cyber-attack scenarios in your organization. If you do not already have phishing simulation capabilities from your primary email security provider, Microsoft’s simulated attacks can help you identify and find vulnerable users, policies and practices before a real attack impacts your organization. Followed by leveraging inbuilt or custom training to reduce risk and better educate end users about threats. – because we deliver messages directly into the inbox, the user experience is rich with no security changes needed to get mail delivered correctly during a simulation.

## Step 3 and beyond, becoming a dual use hero

- Many of the detection, investigation, response & hunting activities described above should be repeated by your security teams, this guidance offers a detailed description of tasks, cadence and team assignments we would recommend.

- Consider user experiences, such as accessing multiple quarantines or the submission / reporting of false positives and false negatives, you can mark messages which are detected by the 3rd party service with a custom X header for example to then allow Defender for Office 365 to detect and quarantine them via transport rules, which would then give users a single place to access quarantined mail.

- The Migration guide contains lots of useful guidance on preparing and tuning your environment ready for a migration, many of the steps are also applicable to a dual use scenario, simply ignore the MX switch guidance in the final steps.
