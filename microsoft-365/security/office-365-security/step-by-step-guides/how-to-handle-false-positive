# How to handle Legitimate emails getting blocked (False Positive) using Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps deal with important legitimate business emails(False Positive) getting blocked. 
It can help you understand why emails are getting blocked, how to resolve the situation immediately and how to prevent similar situations from happening in the future?

## What you'll need

- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1/2 (included as part of E3, E5). EOP customers can also leverage this
- Sufficient permissions (Security Administrator role)
- 5-10 minutes to perform the steps below.

## Dealing with emails landing in junk folder of end users

1. Ask end users to report the email as **not junk** using Microsoft Message Add-in.
2. End users can also add the sender to the [safe sender list](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/safe-senders-in-outlook-com-470d4ee6-e3b6-402b-8cd9-a6f00eda7339) in Outlook to prevent the email from these senders landing in junk folder. 
3. You can triage the user reported messages from [user reported content] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/admin-submission?view=o365-worldwide#view-user-submissions-to-microsoft) portal.
4. From those reported messages you can submit to [Microsoft for analysis] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/admin-submission?view=o365-worldwide#notify-users-from-within-the-portal) and understand why was that email blocked in the first place.
5. If needed while submitting to Microsoft for analysis, you can even create an [allow for the sender] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/manage-tenant-allows?view=o365-worldwide#add-sender-allows-using-the-submissions-portal) to migitate the problem.
6. Once the results for submissions are available, do look into it to understand why emails were blocked and how your tenant setup could be improved to prevent similar situations from happening in the future?

## Dealing with emails landing in quarantine folder of end users

1. End User receives [email digest] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-spam-notifications-to-release-and-report-quarantined-messages?view=o365-worldwide) about quarantined messages as per the settings enabled by you.
2. End users can preview the messages in quarantine, block the sender, release the messages, submit those messages to Microsoft for analysis and even request release of those emails from you. 

## Dealing with emails landing in quarantine folder of admin
1. Admin can view the quarantined emails (including the ones asking permission to request release) from the [review page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/manage-quarantined-messages-and-files?view=o365-worldwide).
2. Admin can release the message from quarantine while submitting it to Microsoft for analysis along with creating an allow to mitigate the situation.
3. Once the results for submissions are available, do look into it to understand why emails were blocked and how your tenant setup could be improved to prevent similar situations from happening in the future?
