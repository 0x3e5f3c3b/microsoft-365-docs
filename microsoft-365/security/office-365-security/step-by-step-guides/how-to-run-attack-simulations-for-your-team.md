# How to run attack simulations for your team

Attack simulation training allows you to run realistic but benign cyber attack scenarios in your organization. Simulated attacks can help you identify and find vulnerable users, policies and practices before a real attack impacts your organization, leveraging inbuilt or custom training to reduce risk and better educate end users about threats.

## What you'll need

- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 (included as part of E5)
- Sufficient permissions (Security Administrator role)
- 5-10 minutes to perform the steps below.

## Send a payload to target users

1. Navigate to [Attack Simulation Training](https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator ) in your subscription.
1. Choose **Simulations** from the top navigation bar.
1. Select **Launch a simulation**.
1. Pick the technique you’d like to use from the flyout, and press **Next**.
1. Name the Simulation with something relevant / memorable and press **Next**.
1. Pick a relevant payload from the wizard, review the details and customize if appropriate, when you are happy with the choice, press **Next**.
1. Choose who to target with the payload. If choosing the entire organization highlight the radio button and press **Next**.
1. Otherwise, select **Add Users** and then search or filter the users with the wizard. Select Add User(s) and then **Next**.
1. Customize the training if appropriate, or otherwise leave **Assign training for me** (recommended) selected and select **Next**.
1. Customize the landing page displayed when a user is phished if appropriate, or otherwise leave as the Microsoft Default and **Next**.
1. Choose if you’d like end user notifications, and if so, select the delivery preferences and customize where needed. Select **Next**.
1. Select when to launch the simulation, and how long it should be valid for, press Next
1. Send a test if you're ready. Review the summary of choices. Click **Submit**.
