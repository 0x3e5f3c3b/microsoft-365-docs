# Submit malware and non-malware to Microsoft for analysis

Anti-malware protection is automatically included for Office 365 customers with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) customers without Exchange Online mailboxes. For more information, see [Anti-malware protection in Office 365](anti-malware-protection.md).

When customers receive an email with a suspected malicious attachment, they often ask, "What do I do now?"

This topic helps answer that question and guides you through our recommended reporting process. Admins can send email, url, and attachments to Microsoft for review. For more informaiton, see [Admin submissions in Office 365 ATP](admin-submission.md).

It's important to understand the difference between an infected and uninfected email message. Any message that has an attachment containing a script or other malicious executable is considered malware. This doesn't include messages with links to malicious sites (these messages would be considered phish; for more information about submitting phish messages, see [Submit spam, non-spam, and phishing scam messages to Microsoft for analysis](submit-spam-non-spam-and-phishing-scam-messages-to-microsoft-for-analysis.md)).

To further combat potential threats, you should:

- Avoid opening messages that look suspicious.

- Never open an attachment from someone you don't know

- Avoid opening attachments in messages that urge you to open or click them.

## Submit malware

If you suspect that your computer or device has been infected by a virus that made it past our filters, you should submit the malware attachment to the [Microsoft Defender Security Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission) website for further analysis. To receive analysis updates, sign into the website, or enter a valid email address. We recommend that you use your Microsoft work or school account email address.

After you've uploaded the file or files, note the **Submission ID** that's created for your sample submission (for example, `7c6c214b-17d4-4703-860b-7f1e9da03f7f`).

After we receive the sample, we'll investigate and we determine that the sample file is malicious, we'll take corrective action to prevent the malware from going undetected.

If you continue receiving infected messages or attachments, then you should copy the message headers from the email message, and contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support for further assistance. Be sure to have your **Submission ID** ready as well.

## Submit non-malware

You can also submit a file that you believe was incorrectly identified as malware to the website (just select **No** for the question, **Do you believe this file contains malware?**).

After we receive the sample, we'll investigate and if we determine that the sample file is clean, we'll take corrective action to prevent the file from being detected as malware.
