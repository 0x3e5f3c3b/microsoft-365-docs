## Step 1: Getting started

### Start your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 trial

After you have initiated the trial and completed the setup process, it may take up to 2 hours for changes to take effect.

We have automatically configured [Preset security policies](preset-security-policies.md) in your environment. These policies represent a baseline protection profile that's suitable for most users. Standard protection includes:

- Safe Links, Safe Attachments and Anti-Phishing policies that are scoped to the entire tenant or subset of users you may have chosen during the trial setup process.
- Protection to SharePoint, OneDrive, Office apps, and Microsoft Teams.

### Enable users to report suspicious content

Defender for Office 365 enables users to report messages to their security teams and allows admins to submit messages to Microsoft for analysis.

- Deploy the [Report Message add-in or the Report Phishing add-in](enable-the-report-message-add-in.md).
- Establish a workflow to [Report false positives and false negatives](report-false-positives-and-false-negatives.md).
- Use the [Submissions portal](admin-submission.md).
