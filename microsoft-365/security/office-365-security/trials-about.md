# About trials

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are currently in Preview, aren't available to everyone, and are subject to change without notice.

The new trials feature is the easiest way to try the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.

Getting started is easy and only takes a couple of clicks. Once setup is complete, all Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 capabilities are available in the organization for up to 90 days.

The default configuration enables and configures Defender for Office 365 specific policies ([Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), [Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md), and [impersonation protection in anti-spam policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)) using the Standard template for [preset security polices](preset-security-policies.md) for all users in the organization. Admins can also customize the policies by editing the settings or scoping the policies to apply to specific users.

During setup, MDO response functionality (found in MDO P2 or equivalent) is also setup for the entire organization. No policy scoping is required.

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the <> card.
