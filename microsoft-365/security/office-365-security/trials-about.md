## About trials

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are currently in Preview, aren't available to everyone, and are subject to change without notice.

The new trials feature is the easiest way to try the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.

Getting started is easy and only takes a couple of clicks. Once setup is complete, all Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2 capabilities are available in the organization for up to 90 days.

## Setting up trials
The new trials feature allows organizations to easiliy setup Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2 capabilities. During setup, Defender for Office 365 policies, specifically ([Safe Attachments](atp-safe-attachments.md), [Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md), and [impersonation protection in anti-spam policies](set-up-anti-phishing-policies.md#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)) are applied using the Standard template for [preset security polices](preset-security-policies.md). By default, the policies are scoped for all users in the organization, although admins can customize the policies during or after setup to apply them to specific users.

During setup, MDO response functionality (found in MDO P2 or equivalent) is also setup for the entire organization. No policy scoping is required.

## Licensing

As part of the trial setup, the Defender for Office 365 licenses are automatically applied to the organization. The licenses are free of charge for the first 90 days.

## Permissions

To start or end the trial, you need to be a member of the **Global Administrator** or **Security Administrator** roles in Azure Active Directory. For details, see [About admin roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## Additional information about trials

Once the trial is configured, it might take up to 2 hours for changes to be available. And, admins must log out and log back in to see the changes.

Admins can disable the trial at any point by going to the <> card.

## Availability

The trials feature is currently in Public Preview. It's available to all exiting Microsoft 365 organizations that have managed account teams, have Exchange Online mailboxes in Canadian datacenters, but who don't have Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 licenses.
