# Strengthen your security posture - Phase 1: Configure capabilities

Welcome to **Phase 1: Configure capabilities** in our **[Strengthen your security posture](/security-posture-solution-overview.md)** solution.

Microsoft 365 Defender provides many capabilities to discover and protect the devices in your organization against threats. This article includes information on the following capabilities you can configure:

1. [Configure device discovery](#1-configure-device-discovery)
2. [Configure ASR in audit mode](#2-configure-asr-in-audit-mode)
3. [Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity](#3-configure-microsoft-defender-for-identity)

Each section contains links to more detailed information on how you can get started with these capabilities.

## 1. Configure device discovery

Device discovery will help you discover unmanaged endpoints that can be onboarded and secured by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on your corporate network.

See [Configure device discovery](../security/defender-endpoint/configure-device-discovery.md) for guidance you can use as a starting point.

## 2. Configure ASR in audit mode

Attack surface reduction rules help reduce your attack surface by minimizing the places where your organization might be vulnerable to cyber attacks. You can test attack surface reduction (ASR) rules to determine if the rules would affect your organization if enabled. The first step in this process is to turn on the ASR rules with the rules set to Audit.

To get started, see [Test attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](../security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md).

## 3. Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity

Use [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to further improve you device discovery capabilities, to learn more see: [improving-device-discoverability-and-classification-within-mde](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/improving-device-discoverability-and-classification-within-mde/ba-p/3625559).
