# Strengthen your security posture - Phase 1: Configure capabilities

Welcome to **Phase 1: Configure capabilities** in our **[Strengthen your security posture](../security/security-posture-solution-overview.md)** solution.

This article includes information on the capabilities you can configure within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to discover and protect the devices in your organization against threats.

|Description|More information| Licensing |
|:----------|:---------------|:---|
|**Configure device discovery** <br /><br /> Device discovery helps you discover unmanaged endpoints that can be onboarded and secured by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on your corporate network. | See [Configure device discovery](../security/defender-endpoint/configure-device-discovery.md) for guidance you can use as a starting point.| Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 |
|**Configure attack surface reduction rules (ASR) in audit mode** <br /><br />Attack surface reduction rules help reduce your attack surface by minimizing the places where your organization might be vulnerable to cyber attacks. You can test ASR rules to determine if the rules would affect your organization if enabled. The first step in this process is to turn on the ASR rules with the rules set to Audit. |To get started, see [Test attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](../security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md).| Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 | Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 |
|**Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity**  <br /><br /> Use [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to further improve you device discovery capabilities. |To learn more see:[Deploy Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/deploy-defender-identity)| [Defender for Identity license information](/defender-for-identity/technical-faq#where-can-i-get-a-license-for-microsoft-defender-for-identity)
