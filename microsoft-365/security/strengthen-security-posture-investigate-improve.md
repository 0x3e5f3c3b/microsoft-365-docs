# Strengthen your security posture - Investigate and improve

Welcome to Phase 3 of [Strengthen your security posture](../security/security-posture-solution-overview.md): **Investigate and improve**.

This table includes information on the capabilities you can configure within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to investigate and improve  the devices in your organization against threats.


|Capability |Description|Get started|
|:----------|:------------|:--------|-------|
|**Configure device discovery** | Device discovery actively finds unmanaged endpoints that can be onboarded and secured by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on your corporate network. <br /><br /> Network discovery capabilities ensure network devices are discovered and added to the asset inventory and integrations with products like Microsoft Defender for IoT will help you locate, identify, and secure IoT devices across your network.| [Device discovery](../security/defender-endpoint/device-discovery.md) <br /><br /> [Configure device discovery](../security/defender-endpoint/configure-device-discovery.md)|
|**Configure attack surface reduction rules (ASR) in audit mode** | Attack surface reduction rules help reduce your attack surface by minimizing the places where your organization might be vulnerable to cyber attacks. You can test ASR rules to determine if the rules would affect your organization if enabled. <br /><br /> The first step in this process is to turn on the ASR rules with the rules set to Audit. | [Test attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](../security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-test.md)|
|**Configure Microsoft Defender for Identity** | Use [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/azure-advanced-threat-protection/what-is-atp) with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to further improve you device discovery capabilities. <br /><br /> To learn more about how Microsoft Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint work together, see: [improving-device-discoverability-and-classification-within-mde](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/improving-device-discoverability-and-classification-within-mde/ba-p/3625559).|[Deploy Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-for-identity/deploy-defender-identity)|


This article describes capabilities you can use to measure your current security posture and actions you can take to start improving it:

1. [Review Microsoft Secure Score](#1-review-microsoft-secure-score)
2. [Take Secure Score recommended actions](#2-take-secure-score-recommended-actions)
3. [Security recommendations](#3-security-recommendations)

## 1. Review Microsoft Secure Score

Microsoft Secure Score reports on the current state of an organization's security posture. To learn more about Secure Score, see [Secure Score Overview](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.md)

To get started with assessing your own security posture, see [Assess your security posture with Microsoft Secure Score](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score-improvement-actions.md).
  
## 2. Take Secure Score recommended actions

To get started, see [Take actions to improve your Secure Score](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score-improvement-actions.md#take-action-to-improve-your-score).

## 3. Security recommendations

To get started see [Security recommendations](../security/defender/microsoft-secure-score-improvement-actions.md#take-action-to-improve-your-score).
