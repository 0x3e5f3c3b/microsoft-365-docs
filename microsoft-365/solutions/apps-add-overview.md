# Add apps to Microsoft Intune

Before you distribute managed apps to your workforce, you first need to add the apps to Intune. In addition, once you've added your apps to include, you should consider creating app protection policies that you can assign to your workforce and the devices your workforce uses.

Intune makes it easy to find and add store apps.
