# Add apps to Microsoft Intune Overview

Before you assign a managed app to your workforce, you first need to add the app to Microsoft Intune. Once added, you can create both configuration and protection policies to support the app. In addition you can monitor the app to ensure it has been installed correctly and protecting your organization's data. When you're ready, you can assign the apps to the members of your organization.

As an IT admin, you can use Microsoft Intune to manage the client apps that your company's workforce uses. This functionality is in addition to managing devices and protecting data. One of an admin's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. This goal can be a challenge because:

- There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
- You might need to manage apps on both company devices and users' personal devices.
- You must ensure that your network and your data remain secure.
- Additionally, you might want to assign and manage apps on devices that are not enrolled with Intune.

The users of apps and devices at your company (your company's workforce) might have several app requirements. Before adding apps to Intune and making them available to your workforce, you may find it helpful to assess and understand a few app fundamentals. There are various types of apps that are available for Intune. You must determine app requirements that are needed by the users at your company, such as the platforms and capabilities that your workforce needs. You must determine whether to use Intune to manage the devices (including apps) or have Intune manage the apps without managing the devices. Also, you must determine the apps and capabilities that your workforce needs, and who needs them. The information in this article helps you get started.

This solution guidance helps you to:
- Determine app requirements and app questions that you should consider
- Provide categories of apps that the members of your organization use
- Acquire and add apps to Intune in-volume
- Add apps based on recommended options
- Understand how to manage apps and confirm app license use
