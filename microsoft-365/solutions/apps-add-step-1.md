# Step 1. Assess app requirements

As an IT admin, before adding apps to Intune and making them available to the members of your organization, you may find it helpful determine a few app requirements for your organization up front. You must determine app requirements such as the platforms and capabilities that your workforce needs. You must determine whether to use Intune to manage the devices (including apps) or have Intune manage the apps without managing the devices. Also, you must determine the apps and capabilities that your workforce should use, and who needs them. 

Determine your organization's requirements by asking the following questions:

1. Does my organization need to use Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Mobile Application Management (MAM)?
2. What platforms do members of my organization use?
3. Which apps are needed to access company information and data?
4. Which groups of users need specific apps?
5. Is there a special configuration needed for each app?
6. Does each app need protection?

## MDM verses MAM



## Determine the platforms needed for each app

Intune commonly supports the following platforms:
- Windows
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Android



> [!NOTE]
> Intune also supports Linux.
 


## Groups of users that need the app
<!--  
The users of apps and devices at your company (your company's workforce) might have several app requirements. 
-->
## Configuration of each app
<!-- 
configuration policies to apply for those groups
-->
## Protection needed for each app
<!-- 
protection policies to apply
Start with level 1

For example, for enrollment types including Android personally-owned work profile, you may want to deploy a web browsing app to make sure users will have a way to open links.
