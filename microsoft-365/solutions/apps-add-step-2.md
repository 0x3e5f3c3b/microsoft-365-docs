# Step 2. Create and edit categories for apps

App categories can be used to help you sort apps to make them easier for users to find in the company portal. You can assign one or more categories to an app, for example, *Developer apps* or *Communication apps*.

When you add an app to Intune, you are given the option to select the category you want. Use the platform-specific topics to add an app and assign categories. To create and edit your own categories, use the following procedure:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Apps** > **App categories**.  
    The **App categories** pane displays a list of current categories.
3. Do either of the following:
    - To add a category, in the **Create category** pane, select **Add**, and then enter a name for the category.  
    Names can be entered in one language only, and they are not translated by Intune.
    - To edit a category, select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the category, and then select **Pin to dashboard** or **Delete**.
4. Select **Create**.
