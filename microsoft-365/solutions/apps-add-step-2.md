# Step 2. Create and edit categories for apps

App categories can be used to help you sort apps to make them easier for users to find in the company portal. You can assign one or more categories to an app. 

Consider adding apps that fall into the following categories:
- Featured
- Education
- Productivity
- Developer
- Communication
- Security
- Tools
- Utilities
- Storage

When you add an app to Intune, you are given the option to select the category you want. Use the platform-specific topics to add an app and assign categories. For more information, see [Create and edit categories for apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add#create-and-edit-categories-for-apps).
