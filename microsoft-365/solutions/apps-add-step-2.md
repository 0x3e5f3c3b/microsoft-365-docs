# Step 2. Create and edit categories for apps

App categories can be used to help you sort apps to make them easier for end-users to find in the Company Portal. The Company Portal app, Company Portal website, and Intune app on Android are where end-users access company data and can do common tasks related to app management. Common task may include enrolling devices, installing apps, and locating information (such as for assistance from your IT department). Additionally, the Company Portal allows end-users to securely access company resources. The end-user experience provides several different pages, such as Home, Apps, App details, Devices, and Device details. To quickly find available apps within the Company Portal, end-users can filter the apps on the **Apps** page. As the admin, you can assign one or more categories to an app.

Consider adding apps that fall into the following categories:
- Featured
- Education
- Productivity
- Developer
- Communication
- Security
- Tools
- Utilities
- Storage

When you add an app to Intune, you are given the option to select the category you want. Use the platform-specific topics to add an app and assign categories. For more information, see [Create and edit categories for apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add#create-and-edit-categories-for-apps).
