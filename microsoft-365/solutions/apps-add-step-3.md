# Step 3. Purchase or acquire apps

When your organization purchases a license to use Microsoft Intune, depending on your license, there are several Microsoft communication and productivity apps included with your license. Additionally, many of the store apps are free to add to Intune and assign to members of your organization.

## Determine if you need to purchase apps

If the app you need to add to Intune is not freely available as a store app or as part of your Intune license, you can consider purchasing the app.

There are three primary ways you would purchase an app:
- Purchase Apple store apps in-volume using Apple Business Manager (ABM). ABM provides an app Volume Purchase Program (VPP). 
- Work with a app vendor to purchase a subscription or license to use a specific app based on platform. For a list of apps that have been designed to work with Intune, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-supported-intune-apps).
- Purchase a line-of-business (LOB) app from an app developer or vendor:
    - A customized app that has been specifically designed or modified for your organization.
    - An app that has been created specifically for your organization by an app developer.

## Purchase apps in-volume from Apple

App licenses that can be purchased in-volume are purchased through a volume purchase program (VPP). Only Apple lets you purchase multiple app licenses using Apple Business Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confirm that your [mobile device management (MDM) authority](/mem/intune/fundamentals/mdm-authority-set) is set to **Microsoft Intune** before purchasing or adding apps to Intune in-volume.


> [!NOTE]
> Most apps offered through a volume purchase program are free to add to Intune, however an app license (token) must be purchased through the volume purchase program (VPP)

### Apple Business Manager

Apps for Apple devices that run iOS/iPadOS can be purchased in-volume using Apple Business Manager. Apple Business Manager is a web-based portal that allows you to purchase apps that can be managed by Intune.

Use the following steps to set up in-volume app purchases for iOS/iPadOS devices:

1. [Set up Apple Business Manager](apps-purchase-volume.md#set-up-apple-business-manager).
2. [Purchase apps using Apple Business Manager](apps-purchase-volume.md#purchase-apps-using-apple-business-manager).
3. [Sync purchased Apple app licenses with Microsoft Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md#sync-purchased-apple-app-licenses-with-microsoft-intune).
