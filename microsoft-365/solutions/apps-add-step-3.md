# Step 3. Purchase apps

When your organization purchases a license to use Microsoft Intune, depending on your license, there are several Microsoft communication and productivity apps included with your license. Additionally, many of the store apps are free to add to Intune and assign to members of your organization. 

## Determine if you need to purchase apps

There are three primary ways you would purchase app content:
- Purchase store apps in-volume using a Volume Purchase Program (VPP).
- Work with a app vendor to purchase a subscription or license to use a specific app. For a list of apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-supported-intune-apps).
- Purchase a line-of-business app from an app developer or vendor:
    - A customized app that has been specifically modified for your organization.
    - An app that has been created specifically for your organization by an app developer.

## Purchase a VPP app

App licenses that you purchase in-volume are purchased through a volume purchase program (VPP). Apple lets you purchase multiple app licenses using Apple Business Manager. Microsoft offers the Microsoft Store for Business. Depending on your Microsoft Intune license, you may already have Microsoft app licenses available to add and deploy.
