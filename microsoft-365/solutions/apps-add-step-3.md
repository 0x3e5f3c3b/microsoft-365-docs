# Step 3. Purchase apps

When your organization purchases a license to use Microsoft Intune, depending on your license, there are several Microsoft communication and productivity apps included with your license. Additionally, many of the store apps are free to add to Intune and assign to members of your organization. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confirm that your [mobile device management (MDM) authority](/mem/intune/fundamentals/mdm-authority-set) is set to **Microsoft Intune** before purchasing or adding apps to Intune in-volume.

## Determine if you need to purchase apps

There are three primary ways you would purchase app content:
- Purchase store apps in-volume using a Volume Purchase Program (VPP).
- Work with a app vendor to purchase a subscription or license to use a specific app. For a list of apps, see [Microsoft Intune protected apps](/mem/intune/apps/apps-supported-intune-apps).
- Purchase a line-of-business app from an app developer or vendor:
    - A customized app that has been specifically modified for your organization.
    - An app that has been created specifically for your organization by an app developer.

## Purchase apps in-volume

App licenses that you purchase in-volume are purchased through a volume purchase program (VPP). Apple lets you purchase multiple app licenses using Apple Business Manager. Microsoft offers the Microsoft Store for Business. Google provides the Managed Google Play store.

> [!NOTE]
> Most apps offered through a volume purchase program are free to add to Intune.

### Apple Business Manager

Apps for Apple devices that run iOS/iPadOS can be purchased in-volume using Apple Business Manager. Apple Business Manager is a web-based portal that allows you to purchase apps that can be managed by Intune.

Use the following steps to set up in-volume app purchases for iOS/iPadOS devices:

1. [Set up Apple Business Manager](apps-purchase-volume.md#set-up-apple-business-manager).
2. [Purchase apps using Apple Business Manager](apps-purchase-volume.md#purchase-apps-using-apple-business-manager).
3. [Sync purchased Apple app licenses with Microsoft Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md#sync-purchased-apple-app-licenses-with-microsoft-intune).

### Microsoft Store for Business

Apps for Windows devices that run Window OS can be purchased in-volume using [Microsoft Store for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store). Microsoft Store for Business is a web-based portal that allows you to find and purchase apps that can be managed by Intune. Depending on your Microsoft Intune license, you may already have Microsoft app licenses available to add and deploy.

Use the following steps to set up in-volume app purchases for Windows devices:

1. [Set up Microsoft Store for Business](apps-purchase-volume.md#set-up-apple-business-manager).
2. [Purchase apps using Microsoft Store for Business](apps-purchase-volume.md#purchase-apps-using-apple-business-manager).
3. [Sync purchased Windows app licenses with Microsoft Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md#sync-purchased-windows-app-licenses-with-microsoft-intune).

### Managed Google Play store

Apps for Android devices that run Android OS can be acquired in-volume from the Managed Google Play store. The Managed Google Play store is a web-based portal that allows you to sync and manage apps using Intune.

Use the following steps to sync apps from the Managed Google Play store with Intune:

1. [Connect Your Intune tenant to Managed Google Play](apps-purchase-volume.md#set-up-apple-business-manager).
2. [Approve Managed Google Play apps](apps-purchase-volume.md#purchase-apps-using-apple-business-manager).
3. [Sync Managed Google Play apps with Microsoft Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md#add-a-managed-google-play-store-app-to-intune).
