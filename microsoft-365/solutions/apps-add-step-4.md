# Step 4. Add apps to Intune

Once you have assessed your app requirements, created categories for your apps in Intune, and purchased any needed apps that aren't free, you can add the apps to Intune.

## Determine apps included with your Intune license

The first apps that you should consider adding to Intune are those [apps included as part of your Intune license](apps-license-overview.md#microsoft-app-licenses-included-with-intune). 

For instance, if you have a Microsoft 365 E5 license, consider adding the following apps to Intune:
- Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Microsoft Exchange, Microsof Teams, SharePoint, Yammer Enterprise, and Viva Connections
(check this list against the M365 apps pane)

For more information, see [App functionality included with Microsoft 365 E5 license](apps-license-overview.md#app-functionality-included-with-microsoft-365-e5-license).
