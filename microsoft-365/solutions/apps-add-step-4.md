# Step 4. Add apps to Intune

Once you have assessed your app requirements, created categories for your apps in Intune, and purchased any needed apps that aren't free, you can add the apps to Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify that an app is required on the end-user's device. If the user modifies a required app (such as deleting it), Intune will automatically reinstall, update, or remove a required app within 24 hours.

Intune automatically installs the following apps:


## Add apps included with your Intune license

The first apps that you should consider adding to Intune are those [apps included as part of your Intune license](apps-license-overview.md#microsoft-app-licenses-included-with-intune). 

For instance, if you have a Microsoft 365 E5 license, consider adding the following apps to Intune first:
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Microsoft OneNote
- Microsoft Outlook
- Microsoft  Teams

These apps support the Core Intune App Protection Policy settings and are also capable of supporting advanced App Protection Policy and App Configuration Policy settings. Each app has a different protection and configuration capabilities. These capabilities include the following:

- Core app protection policy settings
- App configuration
- Org allowed accounts
- Sync policy managed app data with native apps
- Org data notifications
- Open data into Org documents
- Save copies of org data
