# Step 5. Manage apps and licenses

Microsoft Intune makes it easy to manage the app licenses used by each member of your organization. 

## Manage app licenses

There are two areas of Intune used to manage app licenses:
- Connector status is used to keep your app license in sync with the app license provider.
- Monitor app licenses is used to keep your app instances in sync with Intune.

### Connector status

### Monitor app licenses

## Manage apps

The **Apps** pane provides a list of all the apps that you have added to Intune. 

### App reports
