# Configure apps using Microsoft Intune

Once you've [set up and deployed the capabilities of Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-guide-overview#deploying-intune) and you've [added apps you want to manage to Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-add-overview), you can begin the process of creating app configuration policies so that members of your organization (end-users) can easily install and use those apps on their devices. You create app configuration policies directly in Intune that are unique for each app.

> [!NOTE]
> Intune provides a web-based console to manage, protect, and monitor all of your organization's endpoints, whether those endpoints are devices or apps.

 App configuration policies can help you eliminate app setup problems by letting you assign configuration settings to a policy that is then assigned to end-users before they run the app. The settings are then supplied automatically when the app is configured on the end-user's device. Most importantly, end-users don't need to take action. You can create and use app configuration policies to provide configuration settings for both iOS/iPadOS or Android apps. The configuration policy settings are used when the app checks for these settings, typically the first time the app is run.

For example, an app configuration setting might require you to specify any of the following details:
- A custom port number
- Language settings
- S/MIME settings
- Security and protection settings
- Branding settings (such as a company logo)

If end-users were to enter these settings instead, they could do this incorrectly. App configuration policies can help provide consistency across an enterprise and reduce helpdesk calls from end-users trying to configure settings on their own. By using app configuration policies, the adoption of new apps can be easier and quicker.

The available configuration parameters and the implementation of the configuration parameters are decided by the developers of the application. Documentation from the application vendor should be reviewed to see what configurations are available and how the configurations influence the behavior of the application. For some applications, Intune will populate the available configuration settings.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and manage apps with Microsoft Intune, you must follow a few prerequisites to set up Intune, as well as understand key app management configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're new to Intune, start with the [Microsoft Intune free trail](/mem/intune/fundamentals/free-trial-sign-up). Trying out Intune is free for 30 days. When you complete the sign-up process, you'll have a new tenant that you can use to evaluate Intune. A tenant is a dedicated instance of [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) where your subscription to Intune is hosted. You can then configure the tenant, which involves many capabilities that you can use to protect your organization. One of those involves adding and configuring apps for Intune.

Follow these steps if you haven't already set up Intune and added the apps you need to manage:
1. Set up and [deploy Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-guide-overview?toc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=o365-worldwide#deploying-intune)
2. Understand [Mobile Application Management configurations](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-guide-overview?toc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=o365-worldwide#mobile-application-management-configurations)
3. [Understand app types](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-guide-overview?toc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=o365-worldwide#understand-app-types)
4. [Add apps to Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-add-overview?toc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fmem%2Fintune%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=o365-worldwide)

## What's in this solution

This solution steps you through the process of creating app configuration policies in Microsoft Intune for specific apps and assigning those policies to your organization. Once you've completed the above prerequisites, you're ready to create app protection policies for your organization in Intune. Using configuration and protection policies as part of your app management efforts allows members of your organization to safely use apps. By managing apps at your organization, you help to protect and secure your organizationâ€™s data.
