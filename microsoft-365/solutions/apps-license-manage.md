# Manage app licenses used in Intune

The process of aquiring app licenses and adding apps to Intune is intermixed. To purchase app licenses, you must create a business account for each platform's store and follow their process to purchase licenses and tokens. This process is call the "volume purchase program". Each token represents a individual user license for the related app. Once you have purchased the app tokens that you need, you can sync those tokens with Intune. Once the tokens have been sync'd with Intune, you can add the app to Intune and assign the app to end users.

For more information about purchasing apps in-volume for each platform type, see [Purchase apps in-volume for Intune](apps-purchase-volume.md).
