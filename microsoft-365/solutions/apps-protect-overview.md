# Secure and protect apps using Microsoft Intune

Once you've [set up and deployed the capabilities of Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-guide-overview#deploying-intune), [added the apps you want to manage to Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-add-overview), and [configured the apps that you manage in Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-config-overview), you can begin the process of creating app protection policies. App protection policies (APP) are rules that ensure your organization's data remains safe and contained in a managed app. An app protection policy can contain a rule that is enforced when the user attempts to access or move "corporate" data, or a set of actions that are prohibited or monitored when the user is inside the app.

Managed apps are apps that you have assigned to users via a unified endpoint management provider, such as Intune. Managed apps support app protection policies, as well as app configuration policies. These apps use mobile application management (MAM) that is provided by the unified endpoint management provider. MAM enables organizations to manage and protect their data within an application. A managed app has either integrated the Intune App SDK or has been wrapped using the Intune Wrapping Tool and supports App Protection Policies (APP) and/or app configuration policies. you to protect apps on unmanaged (nonenrolled) devices.
