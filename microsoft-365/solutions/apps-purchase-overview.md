# Purchase apps for a managed environment

There are a variety of apps that you can use with Microsoft Intune. Some apps are free for your workforce to use, while other apps require either a license and/or an account for each user to use the app. For instance, Microsoft Outlook requires both a license and an account to use the app. Within the Intune console, you can select store apps and add them to Intune. Based on the supported integration with Intune, you can then configure these apps so that your workforce can easily set them up based on your unique company requirements and also set up app protection policies for the apps. 

## Apps available for purchase

Common types of apps purchases:
- Individual store apps
- Volume purchased apps
- Partner productivity apps
- Partner UEM apps
- In-app purchases

### Individual store apps

Intune integrates directly with the different supported platform stores. Within Intune, you can find and select free apps for Windows, iOS, and Android. Intune displays the available store apps directly in the Intune console. You can select each app by platform and choose the users that will receive the app.

### Volume purchased apps

Each device platform has a method to purchase apps for your organization in bulk:
- Apple provides the Apple Business Manager
