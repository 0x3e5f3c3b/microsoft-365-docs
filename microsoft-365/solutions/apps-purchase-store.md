# Purchase store apps for a managed environment

Before you can distribute apps to your workforce, you must add them to Intune. Many of the apps that you use with Microsoft Intune can be added to Intune and and deployed to user's devices for free. Some apps are free for your workforce to use, while other apps require either a license and/or an account for each user to use the app. For instance, Microsoft Outlook requires both a license and an account to use the app. 

Each device platform has a method to purchase apps for your organization in bulk:
- Apple provides the Apple Business Manager
- Google provides Managed Google Play
- Microsoft provide the Microsoft Store for Business
