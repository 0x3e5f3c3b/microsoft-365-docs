# Purchase store apps for a managed environment

Before you can distribute apps to your workforce, you must add them to Intune. Many of the apps that you use with Microsoft Intune can be added to Intune and and deployed to user's devices for free. Some apps are free for your workforce to use, while other apps require either a license and/or an account for each user to use the app. For instance, Microsoft Outlook requires both a license and an account to use the app. 

Each device platform has a method to purchase apps for your organization in bulk:
- Apple provides the Apple Business Manager
- Google provides Managed Google Play
- Microsoft provide the Microsoft Store for Business


## Find apps to purchase



## Types of app purchases


## Purchase apps based on intent



## Removing store limitations

An Android Enterprise fully managed device will not allow employees to install any apps that are not approved by the organization. Also, employees will not be able to remove any installed apps against policy. If you wish to allow users to access the full Google Play store to install apps rather than only having access to the approved apps in Managed Google Play store, you can set the **Allow access to all apps in Google Play store** to **Allow**. With this setting, the user can access all the apps in the Google Play store using their corporate account, however purchases may limited. You can remove the limited purchases restriction by allowing users to add new accounts to the device. Doing so will enable end users to have the ability to purchase apps from the Google Play store using personal accounts, as well as conduct in-app purchases. For more information, see [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).
