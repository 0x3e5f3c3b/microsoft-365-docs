When possible, instead of using store app types, we recommend that you use the built-in app type. By using the built-in app type, you have the additional flexibility to edit and delete Microsoft 365 apps.

## Apps that are built-in

| App type | Description |

| Built-in iOS/iPadOS app | Built-in iOS/iPadOS apps are specific apps that have been designed to work with Microsoft Intune.   |
| Built-in Android app | Built-in Android app are specific apps that have been designed to work with Microsoft Intune. |
