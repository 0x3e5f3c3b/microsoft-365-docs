# Understand web apps in a managed environment

Intune supports a variety of app types, including web apps and web links. A web app is commonly recognized as a client-server application. A web link is simply a URL to a web page. 

A web app can be complex when it is designed as a client-service application. The server provides the web app, which includes the UI, content, and functionality. Additionally, modern web-hosting platforms commonly offer security, load balancing, and other benefits. A web app is separately maintained on the web. You use Microsoft Intune to point to this app type. You also assign the groups of users that can access this app.

A web link (or web clip) is a URL that displays a web page within a protected browser on the user's device. Intune creates a shortcut to the web app on the user's device. For iOS/iPadOS devices, a shortcut to the web app is added to the home screen. For Android Device Admin devices, a shortcut to the web app is added to the Intune company portal widget and the widget needs to be pinned manually by the user. For Windows devices, a shortcut to the web app is placed on the Start Menu.

> [!NOTE]
> A browser must be installed on the user's device to launch web apps.
