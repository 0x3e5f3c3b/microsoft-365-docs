# Manage data privacy and data protection with Microsoft Priva and Microsoft Purview

At least 71% of countries have passed or introduced data privacy legislation, according to the United Nations. Chances are good that your organization is based in, or has customers or employees in, regions with data privacy laws. One of the most prominent and sweeping such laws is the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr). Many organizations are subject to overlapping regulations that themselves are frequently updated. As the regulatory landscape expands, it's never been more critical for organizations to safeguard personal data while staying on top of changes. Failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations can result in considerable financial penalties, legal and business repercussions, and erosion of your customers' trust.

Data privacy and data protection go hand in hand. You can't have data privacy without data protection. Data protection helps protect personal data stored and managed by your organization from external threats and leakage. Data privacy provides another layer of sophisticated protection, which helps honor the purpose of personal data use and respects a data subject's rights throughout the data lifecycle. To help organizations regardless of size or location fortify their data privacy and protection posture, we offer robust and scalable solutions in Microsoft Priva and Microsoft Purview.
