# Deploy voice calling with Teams in Microsoft 365

Microsoft provides a choice of voice solutions so that you choose the one that best fits your business needs and requirements.

A voice solution consists of Microsoft's Phone System and a choice of options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

Phone System provides complete Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities for your organization. Calls between users in your organization--no matter their geographic location--are handled internally within Phone System removing long-distance costs on these internal calls.  

To enable users to make calls outside your organization, you need to connect Phone System to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

This solution guidance helps you to:

- Choose the voice solution that is appropriate for your organization
- Deploy the voice solution you selected
