# Step 5: Create COVID-19 crisis communication venues

There are many ways you can provide additional communication venues to serve the unique requirements of the COVID-19 crisis, including:

- Employee surveys
- Consolidated public health and news into a single portal
- A communications site in SharePoint Online
- A Yammer community

## Employee surveys

The [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/), including Power Automate and Power Apps, can be used to communicate with remote workers in a number of ways. For example, [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.microsoft.com/) can be used to survey your remote workers and determine:

- What devices users have at home and their type and platform.
- If users have capable Internet capability at home.
- If thin clients or desktop and app virtualization can be leveraged for remote workers.
- If additional user training is needed for remote work scenarios.
- If there are any blockers to enabling remote work.

## Internal portal for consolidated public health and news

The free [Crisis Communication app](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/coordinate-crisis-communications-using-microsoft-teams-power/ba-p/1216715) can be used to provide your users with a single portal to help ensure they are equipped with recommendations from global health authorities, topical world news, the latest information from government officials and experts, and company-specific content including relevant contacts, company news, and links to support channels. 

Users can also share their status (such as working from home or out of the office) with their teammates, and automatically send help requests to a dedicated channel in Teams.

## SharePoint Online communications site

Another option for organization-wide communication is a crisis management site in SharePoint. This is effectively a SharePoint communication site that you can use to share news, reports, status, and other information in a visually compelling format. 

Communication sites are responsive and can be viewed from anywhere on any device. You can provision a pre-configured crisis management site using [this SharePoint look book design](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/8f8337d2-b1f6-4a84-91a4-9081f841f0f6), or you can follow [these steps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/build-a-crisis-management-site-to-connect-people-and-information/ba-p/1216791) to have a live site up and running within 2 hours.

## Yammer community

[Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/yammer-landing-page) communities can also be used to support remote work and engage people across the organization. Communities connect people across organizational and geographic silos. It’s important to give people a common place to gather and to share experience in a community that brings people together to address a challenge. Leaders and members can:

- **Share announcements at scale.** A community provides a consolidated channel for communication. An announcement reaches members with notifications web, on mobile and in email. The community
promotes quick sharing of information that can bypass corporate bottlenecks even when coming from official channels.
- **Share knowledge.** A community provides a one-stop-shop for people to ask questions and get answers. Knowledge shared is searchable and discoverable, enabling others to find important information.
- **Understand people’s needs.** Organizations can use polls and can monitor the conversation to gain deeper insights about employees and their needs, which in turn accelerates the development and delivery of communications and solutions that address those needs.
- **Reach and engage remote workers wherever they are.** Leaders can even conduct live and on-demand events, to broadcast important messages and to answer questions of the community.
- **Empower and recognize contribution.** Community members can be active participants, contributing ideas, skills, and experience to be part of the solution. Praise can be used to recognize achievements and contribution as the community works through the challenges it faces.
