# Step 3: Deploy security and compliance

For remote workers, some of whom either never come into the office or very infrequently, security and compliance is an important part of the overall solution because all of their communications occur over the Internet. Remote work needs these elements of security:

- Contolled access to the productivity apps that remote workers use, such as Microsoft Teams 
- Controlled access to and protection of the data that remote workers use, such as chat conversations or shared files
- Windows 10 devices need to be protected from malware and other types of cyber attacks

## Security

Protect your applications and data with these security features of Microsoft 365.

### Azure AD Identity Protection

Azure AD Identity Protection, which automates detection and remediation of identity-based risks

### Office ATP 

Microsoft 365 apps and data

Office 365 ATP protects your Microsoft 365 apps and data—such as email messages, Office documents, and collaboration tools—from attack.

It collects and analyzes signals from your apps for detection, investigation, and remediation of security risks.

‎Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection‎ (‎ATP‎) safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools.


### Malware protection

By default, ‎SharePoint‎ Online automatically scans file uploads for known malware. ‎

Exchange Online Protection‎ (‎EOP‎) secures cloud mailboxes by default. If you want to configure stricter policies or use ‎EOP‎ to secure on-premises mailboxes, see the ‎Exchange Online Protection‎ setup guide.

## Microsoft Defender ATP

Use ‎Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection‎ (‎Microsoft‎ Defender ‎ATP‎) to look for attackers masquerading as employees working from home.


Microsoft Defender ATP protects your organization’s devices—also known as endpoints—from cyberthreats, data breaches, and advanced attacks.

It collects and analyzes signals from your devices for analysis of ongoing security risks.

Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

With many employees suddenly working from home, there are things an organization and employees can do to help remain productive without increasing cybersecurity risk.

While employees in this new remote work situation will be thinking about how to stay in touch with colleagues and coworkers using chat applications, shared documents, and replacing planned meetings with conference calls, they may not be thinking about cyberattacks. CISOs and admins need to look urgently at new scenarios and new threat vectors as their organizations become a distributed organization overnight, with less time to make detailed plans or run pilots.

### Cloud App Security

Cloud App Security is a Cloud Access Security Broker, a service that sits between your organization and a cloud provider like Microsoft and others. It acts as a gatekeeper, allowing the organization to extend the reach of their security policies into the cloud.

Cloud App Security uses signals from your cloud-based services—both Microsoft 365 and other SaaS apps—to protect those services from attack.





## Compliance

Comply with legal or regulatory standards with these compliance features of Microsoft 365.

### Sensitivity labels


### DLP

‎Office 365‎ has built-in tools to help prevent the accidental disclosure of sensitive information. You can use the ‎DLP‎ capabilities of ‎Teams‎ and ‎SharePoint‎ to detect inappropriately stored or shared sensitive information.

If part of your remote work strategy involves a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, you can use Conditional Access App Control to prevent sensitive data from being downloaded to users' personal devices.

### Data retention


### Email encryption
