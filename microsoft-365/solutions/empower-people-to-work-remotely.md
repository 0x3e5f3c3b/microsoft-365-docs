# Empower remote workers with Microsoft 365

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, your business may need to enable your workers to have secure access to your organization's on-premises and cloud-based information, tools, and resources from their homes. 

Allowing employees to work away from the office seamlessly and securely is important for many organizations to save on office space, hire and retain employees who are unwilling to relocate, and reduce employee commuting, leaving them with more time to be productive and for stress-reducing activities outside of work.

Remote working, also known as teleworking, can span a spectrum that includes:

- Employees that are occasionally away from the office for conferences or client meetings.
- Some employees that work remotely full-time.
- A fully remote organization in which there is no office and all employees are remote.

To support remote workers, for example in response to the COVID-19 crisis, a combination of features in Microsoft 365 enables your remote workers in a highly collaborative way, such as:

- Online meetings and chat sessions.
- Shared workspaces for cloud-based file storage with global accessibility and real-time collaboration.
- Shared tasks and workflows to divide up the work and get things done.

For strong security, Microsoft 365 includes:

- Enforced authentication requirements, detecting and responding to high-risk sign-ins, and blocking selected apps and non-compliant devices.
- Encrypted connections and digital assets in the cloud.
- Permissions to define who can do what with files.

To meet these criteria for remote workers, use the following Microsoft 365 features:

- User identity and sign-in security
  - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user accounts with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Conditional Access policies to require MFA for risky sign-ins (Microsoft 365 E5)
- Collaboration platforms
  - Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive, with which remote workers can schedule and attend online video-based meetings and work on the same documents at the same time
- Secure access to resources
  - Groups and permissions for Teams, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive so that only authenticated and permitted users have access
- Protection for leaked files
  - Sensitivity labels for encryption and permissions that travel with files
- Device management and security with Microsoft Intune
  - Enrollment for managed devices
  - App settings for personal devices
  - Device and app policies
- Productivity apps for devices
  - Microsoft 365 Apps (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) for collaborative experiences with Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive 
- Windows 10 Enterprise
  - Comprehensive security features to protect against cyberattacks and prevent data leakage
- Access to on-premises apps
  - Organizations that have hybrid identity and web-based apps can use Azure AD Application Proxy instead of virtual private network (VPN) connections
