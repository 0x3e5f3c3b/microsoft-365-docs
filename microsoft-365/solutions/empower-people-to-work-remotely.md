# Empower remote workers with Microsoft 365

Your business may need to enable your workers to have secure access to your organization's on-premises and cloud-based information, tools, and resources from their homes. Allowing workers to work away from the office seamlessly and securely is important for many organizations to:

- Save on office space.
- Hire and retain workers who are unwilling to relocate.
- Reduce worker commuting, leaving them with more time to be productive and for stress-reducing activities outside of work.

Remote working, also known as teleworking, can span a spectrum that includes:

- workers that are occasionally away from the office for conferences or client meetings.
- Some workers that work remotely full-time.
- A fully remote organization in which there is no office and all workers are remote.

To support remote workers, for example in response to the COVID-19 crisis, a combination of features in Microsoft 365 enables your remote workers in a highly collaborative way, such as:

- Online meetings and chat sessions.
- Shared workspaces for cloud-based file storage with global accessibility and real-time collaboration.
- Shared tasks and workflows to divide up the work and get things done.

For strong security, Microsoft 365 includes:

- Enforced authentication requirements, detecting and responding to high-risk sign-ins, and blocking selected apps and non-compliant devices.
- Encrypted connections and digital assets in the cloud.
- Permissions to define who can do what with files.
- Comprehensive security features to protect Windows 10 devices.

To meet these criteria for remote workers, use the following Microsoft 365 features:

- User identity and sign-in security
  - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user accounts with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - A Conditional Access policy to require MFA for risky sign-ins (Microsoft 365 E5)
- Collaboration platforms
  - Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive, with which remote workers can schedule and attend online video-based meetings and work on the same documents at the same time
- Secure access to resources
  - Groups and permissions for Teams, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive so that only authenticated and permitted users have access
- Protection for leaked files
  - Sensitivity labels for encryption and permissions that travel with files
- Device management and security with Microsoft Intune
  - Enrollment for managed devices
  - App settings for personal devices
  - Device and app policies
- Productivity apps for devices
  - Microsoft 365 Apps (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) for collaborative experiences with Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive 
- Windows 10 Enterprise
  - Built-in suite of security features to protect against cyberattacks and prevent data leakage
- Access to on-premises apps and servers
  - Virtual private network (VPN) connections, Azure AD Application Proxy, or Azure Point-to-Site VPN

Use these steps to secure and optimize access to your organization's servers, data, and cloud services and enable maximum worker productivity.
