# Key Compliance and Security Considerations for the Energy Industry

## Introduction
The energy industry provides society with fuel and critical infrastructure that people rely on every day.  In order to ensure the reliability of infrastructure related to bulk power systems, regulatory authorities impose strict standards on energy industry organizations.  These regulatory standards relate not only to the generation and transmission of power, but also to the data and communications that are critical to the day to day operations of energy companies.  

Organizations in the energy industry work with and exchange numerous types of information as part of their regular operations, including customer data, capital engineering design documentation, resource location maps, project management artifacts, performance metrics, field service reports, environmental data and performance metrics.  As these organizations look to transform their operations and collaboration systems into modern digital platforms, they are looking to Microsoft as a trusted Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and Microsoft 365 as their best-of-breed collaboration platform.  Since Microsoft 365 is intrinsically built on the Microsoft Azure platform, organizations should examine both platforms as they consider their compliance and security controls when moving to the Cloud.

In North America, the North America Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) enforces reliability standards that are referred to as NERC [Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Pages/CIPStandards.aspx).  NERC is subject to oversight by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and governmental authorities in Canada.  All bulk power system owners, operators, and users must register with NERC and must comply with NERC CIP standards.  Cloud Service Providers and third-party vendors such as Microsoft are not subject to NERC CIP standards; however, the CIP standards include objectives that should be considered when Registered Entities use vendors in the operation of the Bulk Electric System (BES). Microsoft customers operating Bulk Electric Systems are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with NERC CIP standards.
