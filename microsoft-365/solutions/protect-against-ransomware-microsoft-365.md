# Deploy protection against ransomware with Microsoft 365

What are the preventative steps to minimize the damage from a ransomware attack, in order of urgency? 

1. Prevent a ransomware attacker from obtaining financial leverage and executing the activies leading to the ransom demand (already banked).

   Assume attacker has the credentials to access your tenant and can laterally move around to discover targets.

   Protect your ransomable targets: Step 1

   Prevent credential escalation and privileged access: Step 2

2. Prevent a ransomware attacker from getting in (not banked). (Step 3)

## Next steps
