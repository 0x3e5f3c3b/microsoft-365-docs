# Step 5. Device and app management for your Microsoft 365 for enterprise tenancies

Summary statement

## Organization-owned devices enrolled and managed (MDM)

## Apps for personal devices managed (MAM)

## Intune device and app policies

## Based on existing content

To help you secure and protect your organization's resources, Microsoft 365 for enterprise includes features to help manage devices and their access to apps.

There are two options for device management:

- [Microsoft Intune](#microsoft-intune)
- [Basic Mobility and Security](#basic-mobility-and-security)

## Microsoft Intune

You can use Microsoft Intune to manage access to your organization using mobile device management or mobile application management. Mobile device management is when users "enroll" their devices in Intune. After a device is enrolled, it is a managed device; therefore, it can receive your organization's  policies, rules, and settings. For example, you can install specific apps, create a password policy, install a VPN connection, and more.

Users with their own personal devices may not want to enroll their devices or be managed by Intune and your organization's policies. But you still need to protect your organization's resources and data. In this scenario, you can protect your apps using mobile application management. For example, you can use a mobile application management policy that requires a user to enter a PIN when accessing SharePoint Online on the device.

You'll also determine how you're going to manage personal devices and organization-owned devices. You might want to treat devices differently, depending on their uses.

## Basic Mobility and Security

This is built into Microsoft 365 and helps you secure and manage your users' mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Androids, and Windows phones. You can create and manage device security policies, remotely wipe a device, and view detailed device reports.

## Choose between the two options

To help you better assess which device management option is best for you, see [Choose between Basic Mobility Security and Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/choose-between-mdm-and-intune).

Based on your assessment, you can manage your devices and their access to apps with:

- [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/planning-guide).
- [Basic Mobility and Security](https://support.microsoft.com/office/set-up-basic-mobility-and-security-dd892318-bc44-4eb1-af00-9db5430be3cd).
 
## Identity and device access recommendations

Microsoft provides a set of recommendations for [identity and device access](../security/office-365-security/microsoft-365-policies-configurations.md) to ensure a secure and productive workforce. For device access, use the recommendations and settings in these articles:

- [Prerequisites](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-prerequisites.md)
- [Common identity and device access policies](../security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies.md)
