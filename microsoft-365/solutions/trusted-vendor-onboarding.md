# Onboard trusted vendors to collaborate in Microsoft 365

If your organization has an approval process for access to Microsoft 365 by external organizations, you can use features in Azure Active Directory and Teams to block access from unapproved organizations and add new organizations as they're approved.




[Collaborate with guests in a team (IT Admins)](collaborate-as-team.md)

#### SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B

[SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Azure AD B2B](/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration)

[Restrict sharing of SharePoint and OneDrive content by domain](/sharepoint/restricted-domains-sharing)



## Allow the vendor's domain in Azure AD external collaboration settings


[Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/allow-deny-list)

## Allow the vendor's domain in Azure AD cross-tenant access settings

Default on is fine. If already configured, check settings. Only for other AAD organizations.

[Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration)

## Allow the vendor's domain in Azure AD B2B direct connect

If you're using shared channels, then configure the shared channel settings.
