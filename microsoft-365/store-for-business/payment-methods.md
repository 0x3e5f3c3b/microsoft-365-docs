> Certain actions, like updating or adding a payment option, require temporary “test authorization” transactions to validate the payment option. These may appear on your statement as $0.00 authorizations or as small pending transactions. These transactions are temporary and should not impact your account unless you make several changes in a short period of time, or have a low balance.
