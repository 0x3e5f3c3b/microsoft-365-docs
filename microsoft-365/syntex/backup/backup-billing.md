# Set up pay-as-you-go billing for Microsoft 365 Backup (Preview)

As a first step to sign up for Microsoft 365 Backup, you should first link an Azure subscription in Syntex pay-as-you-go, if you have not already done so. Although Microsoft 365 Backup is not part of the Syntex product suite, this offering is still leveraging the Syntex billing setup for consistency with other Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go offerings.
