# View the status of a file being processed by Microsoft Syntex

<sup>**Applies to:**  &ensp; &#10003; All custom models &ensp; | &ensp; &#10003; All prebuilt models</sup>

In a document library, there is now a **Classification status** column that lets you know the status of a file being processed by a model in Microsoft Syntex.

The status shows you whether processing of file is in progress, completed, or wasnâ€™t done due to an error with the file or the job. This helps you know whether a file needs to be queued again for processing or if additional investigation is required.  

There is no impact to any existing library configuration. When a model is applied to a library, the new status column is added.  

This column won't be automatically added to libraries where a model has already been applied. To add the column, you'll need to apply the model again.

| Classification status | Description |
| ------- | ------- 
| In progress | File has been queued for processing. |
| Finished | File has been processed. |
| Not supported | File has been queued, but can't be processed (for example, the file type extension is not supported). |
| Error | File can't be queued for processing (for example, the file is not supported at all). |
| [Empty] | No models have been applied to the library. |
