# Overview of Microsoft Syntex eSignature

Microsoft Syntex eSignature simplifies the process of signing and sharing documents, while providing the security and compliance of Microsoft 365.

With Syntex eSignature, you can quickly and securely send documents for signature to people both inside and outside of your organization. You'll also have a digital audit trail, which can be used to verify the authenticity of documents and transactions.

## Before you begin

Before you can use Syntex eSignature, an admin must [set up Syntex eSignature](esignature-setup.md) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

You must be signed in to SharePoint Online by using your work email address.

### Supported file types

Syntex eSignature is available for only PDF documents at this time.

### Limitations and plans

- Currently, Syntex eSignature is available for the US market only. If a tenant's location is in the United States, Syntex eSignature will be available for that tenant. For US-located, multi-geo enabled tenants, eSignature will be available in the home geo only. The feature will roll out to other regions in 2024.

- Syntex eSignature will support third-party electronic signature providers in 2024. Starting with Adobe Acrobat Sign and DocuSign, you will be able to request signatures on documents in SharePoint.

- You will be able to track your Syntex eSignature requests using the Approval app in Microsoft Teams in 2024.
