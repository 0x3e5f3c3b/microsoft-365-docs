# Overview of the OCR service in Microsoft Syntex

Optical character recognition (OCR) in Microsoft Syntex lets you extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, drawings, and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices.

The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. The extracted information is indexed in search and can be made available for [compliance features like data loss prevention (DLP)](#compliance-center).

For example, you have an image file in your document library. With the OCR service enabled, Syntex automatically scans the image, extracts the relevant text, and makes the text from the image available for search and indexing. This lets you quickly and accurately find the keywords and phrases you're looking for.

## Prerequisites

### Licensing

Before you can use the OCR service in Syntex, you must first enter your Azure subscription in [Syntex pay-as-you-go](syntex-azure-billing.md). OCR in Syntex is billed based on the [type and number of transactions](syntex-pay-as-you-go-services.md). 

### Permissions

You must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions to be able to access the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a> and set up the OCR service in Syntex.

## Set up OCR

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997" target="_blank">**Setup**</a>, and then select **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex**.

2. On the **Use content AI with Microsoft Syntex** page, select **Manage Microsoft Syntex**. 

3. On the **Manage Microsoft Syntex** page, select **OCR**.

4. On the **OCR** page, select the SharePoint libraries where you want to enable OCR. The default is no SharePoint libraries, but you can select **Edit** to choose specific SharePoint libraries or to choose all SharePoint libraries.

[Setup and manage will be mostly likely moved to a separate admin article, in which case it will just be linked to from here.]

### Compliance portal

The compliance admin can also specify which SharePoint sites to enable OCR to make that text available for DLP policies. If there are different sites specified in the two set up locations, the maximum number of sites will be enabled for OCR. You won't be charged twice for processing. To learn more about the compliance portal configuration of OCR, see [link to article when available].

In the compliance portal, OCR can be configured for Exchange embedded images and attachments, Teams embedded images, SPO and ODB image-only PDF and TIFF, EXO all PDF and TIFF, and endpoint image-only PDF and TIFF and images. If the compliance admin has configured OCR, you'll be able to see a message in the Syntex set up area indicating that something has been configured in compliance.
