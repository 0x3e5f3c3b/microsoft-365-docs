# Overview of OCR in Microsoft Syntex

Optical character recognition (OCR) in Microsoft Syntex lets you extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, drawings, and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices.

The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. This makes it possible for text to be available as metadata in search and in document libraries.
