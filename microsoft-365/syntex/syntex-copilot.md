# Overview of Microsoft Syntex in Copilot (Preview)

Microsoft Syntex is now integrated with Microsoft 365 Copilot to bring the power of assistive AI into your organization's intelligent document processing.

Syntex in Copilot analyzes the text of a selected file in a SharePoint document library and generates a set of questions you can ask about the information in the file. The questions can be used to quickly identify the type of document, generate a summary of information in the document, and identify key points or other important information. You can also ask your own questions, such as "When does this contract expire?"

## Get started with Syntex in Copilot

> [!NOTE] 
> For security reasons, this feature won't process files stamped with "Confidential" or "Highly Confidential" sensitivity labels.

## Current limitations

- Limited to Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) file types.
- Works on a single selected file, and it only processes the first 4,000 tokens (approximately six pages). 
- Session responses aren't persisted, but you can copy the information if you want to save it.
