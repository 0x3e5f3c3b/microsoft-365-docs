# Overview of document translation in Microsoft Syntex

> [!NOTE]
> This article is currently in development.

Microsoft Syntex lets you easily translate a selected file or a set of files in a SharePoint document library. Translation is available for all supported languages and dialects, while preserving the original format and structure of the file.

You can translate files manually or automatically. You can use this feature to translate a variety of file types, and apply custom glossaries and models to ensure accurate and consistent translations.
