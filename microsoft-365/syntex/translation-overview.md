# Overview of document translation in Microsoft Syntex

Microsoft Syntex lets you easily create a translated copy of a selected file or a set of files in a SharePoint document library. You can translate a file, while preserving the original format and structure of the file. Translation is available for all supported languages and dialects.

This feature lets you translate files of different types either manually or automatically by creating a rule. You can also use custom glossaries and models to improve the quality and consistency of your translations.

## Requirements and limitations

### Supported file types

Translation is available for the following file types: .doc, .docx, .pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, and .txt.

### Supported languages

Translation is available for [all supported languages and dialects](/azure/ai-services/translator/language-support?source=recommendations#translation).

### Current release notes

- Text on an image within a document is not translated.

- Password-protected files are not translated.

- On-demand translation on folders will be available in a future release.
