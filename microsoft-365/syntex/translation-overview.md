# Overview of document translation in Microsoft Syntex

> [!NOTE]
> This article is currently in development.

Microsoft Syntex lets you easily create a translated copy of a selected file or a set of files in a SharePoint document library. Translation is available for all supported languages and dialects. You can translate a file, while preserving the original format and structure of the file.

This feature lets you translate files of different types either manually or automatically by setting a rule. You can also use custom glossaries and models to improve the quality and consistency of your translations.

## Translate a document on demand

To create a translated version of a document, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select the file or files you want to translate, and then select **Translate**.

2. On the **Translate documents** screen, use the drop-down menu to choose the language into which you want to translate the file, and then select **Translate**.



## Translate a document automatically

To create a rule to translate documents automatically under specific conditions, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select **Automate** > **Rules** > **Create a rule**.

2. On the **Create a rule** page, select **A new file is added**.

3. Under **When a new file is added**, complete the rule statement:

    a. Select **Choose action**, and then select **Create a translated copy in**.

    b. Select **Enter a language**, and then select the language into which you want to translate the file.
