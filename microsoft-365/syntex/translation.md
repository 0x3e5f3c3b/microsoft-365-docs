# Translate a document in Microsoft Syntex

Translation in Microsoft Syntex lets you create a translated copy of a file manually on demand or automatically by using rules. You can set a rule to create a translated copy automatically when a document is created, or when data in a column is modified.â€‹

When a file is translated, the file name of the translated copy is appended to show the ISO code for the language.

## Translate a document on demand

To create a translated version of a document, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select the file or files you want to translate. You can select a file by using either the **More options** (**...**) button on the ribbon or the **Show more actions for this item** button next to the model name, and then select **Translate**.

2. On the **Translate documents** screen, enter a language or use the drop-down menu to choose a language you want to translate the file, and then select **Translate**.

### View the translation activity feed of a document library

When a file is translated, you'll see an update in the source library activity feed. The updates occur in both the source library and the target library.

In the document library, in the upper-right corner of the page, select the details pane icon (![Screenshot of the details pane icon.](../media/content-understanding/details-pane-icon.png)) to view the recent history, activity, and rules that have been applied to the library.
