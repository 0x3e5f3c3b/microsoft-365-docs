# Translate a document in Microsoft Syntex

Translation in Microsoft Syntex lets you create a translated copy of a file manually on demand or automatically by using rules. You can set a rule to create a translated copy automatically when a document is created, or when data in a column is modified.â€‹

When a file is translated, the file name of the translated copy is appended to show the ISO code for the language.

## Translate a document on demand

To create a translated version of a document, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select the file or files you want to translate, and then select **Translate**.

2. On the **Translate documents** screen, use the drop-down menu to choose the language into which you want to translate the file, and then select **Translate**.

3. You'll receive a confirmation message that the file has been translated.

## Translate a document automatically

### When a new file is added

To create a rule to translate documents automatically when a document is created, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select **Automate** > **Rules** > **Create a rule**.

2. On the **Create a rule** page, select **A new file is added**.

3. Under **When a new file is added**, complete the rule statement:

    a. Select **Choose action**, and then select **Create a translated copy in**.

    b. Select **Enter a language**, and then select the language into which you want to translate the file.

4. When your rule statement is complete, select **Create**. You can [see and manage the new rule](content-processing-overview.md#manage-a-rule) on the **Manage rules** page.

### When data in a column changes

To create a rule to translate documents automatically when data in a column changes, follow these steps:

1. From a SharePoint document library, select **Automate** > **Rules** > **Create a rule**.

2. On the **Create a rule** page, select **Data in a column changes**.

3. Under **When data in a column changes**, complete the rule statement:

    a. Select **Choose a column**, and then select **Create a translated copy in**.

    b. Select **Choose  condition**, and then select the appropriate condition under which to translate the file.

    c. Select **Enter a language**, and then select the language into which you want to translate the file.

4. When your rule statement is complete, select **Create**. You can [see and manage the new rule](content-processing-overview.md#manage-a-rule) on the **Manage rules** page.

## View the translation activity feed of a document library

When a file is translated, you'll see an update in the source library activity feed. The updates occur in both the source library and the target library.

In the document library, in the upper-right corner of the page, select the details pane icon (![Screenshot of the details pane icon.](../media/content-understanding/details-pane-icon.png)) to view the recent history, activity, and rules that have been applied to the library.
