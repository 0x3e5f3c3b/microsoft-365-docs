# Memory and CPU Regression Results Overview

The **Test Base** user portal provides separate **Memory utilization** and **CPU utilization** tabs for displaying and analyzing regression data. You can review regression data in the **Processes** table that describes the **Results** and **Details** of the most relevant processes detected. 

Other viewable data includes Memory Utilization Charts that measure utilization in GB in the case of Memory and percent (%) usage in the case of the CPU, versus time. The Test Base service also calculates an average utilization value in each case. A separate Memory Utilization Chart is provided for each operating system test release, as appropriate.

Increases in Memory or CPU utilization can be an indication that an application was affected by an operating system update. **Test Base for Microsoft 365** provides software developers and others with insights into Memory and CPU performance regressions. Such changes in performance may occur when an application is running on different pre-release versions of an upcoming Windows operating system update.
In the sections that follow, more is described about Memory and CPU regression analysis.
