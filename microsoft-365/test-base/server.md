# Windows Server Application Testing 

Are you curious to find out if and how Microsoft's monthly security updates will impact your server applications? We have you covered! 

With Test Base for Microsoft 365, you can now validate your applications against Windows Server 2016 and 2019, including Server Core!

Our Software vendors and test engineers spoke and we listened. Prior to now, Test Base users could only validate their applications against upcoming security updates for Windows 10 client operating systems; with a better understanding of the importance of servers in the software application ecosystem and the essential role they play in this space, we are empowering you to achieve more on our platform!

To get started with validating your uploaded applications against pre-release updates for Windows Server 2016 and 2019 operating systems on Test Base for Microsoft 365, kindly adhere to the following steps:

1.   Log on to our self-service onboarding portal. From the left-side navigation menu, select ```Upload new package``` under ```Package catalogue``` and fill out the Test details.

2.	Select ```Security updates``` as the OS update type:

5. To view test results and insights from the validation of your application against pre-release security updates for Windows Server 2016 and 2019, go to the Test summary page or the Security update results page.
