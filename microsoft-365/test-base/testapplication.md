# Test your application on Test Base
Note: This guide will guide you to create a new Test Base package from scratch. If you already have a Test Base package (.zip) in hand, you can switch to use our legacy upload experience [Upload your package | Microsoft Docs](uploadApplication.md).

## Prerequisites
- A Test Base account. If you don't have one, [create a Test Base account](createAccount.md).

## Create a new package
In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), go to the Test Base account in which you want to upload your package. In the left menu under **Package catalog**, select the **New package**. Then click the first card **‘Create new package’** to build your package within 5 steps!
