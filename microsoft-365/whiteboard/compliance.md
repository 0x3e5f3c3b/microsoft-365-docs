# Compliance standards in Microsoft Whiteboard

Whiteboard on Windows 10, Surface Hub, iOS, and web meet Tier C, which means that they conform to global standards including SOC 1, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and EU Model Clauses. 

Whiteboard doesn't yet support Data Loss Prevention (DLP), eDiscovery, legal hold, or retention policies. Support for these is on the roadmap as we move to OneDrive for Business.
