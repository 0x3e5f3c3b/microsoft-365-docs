# Configure privacy settings in Microsoft Whiteboard

Microsoft is committed to respecting your privacy. As part of that commitment, we provide you with information about what data is collected and used by Microsoft when you’re using Microsoft Whiteboard, as well as privacy settings to control that data. There are privacy settings for diagnostic data and for connected experiences.

Information about these privacy settings is provided to you when you launch Whiteboard for the first time. Afterwards you can review your privacy settings by going to **Settings > Privacy and security**.

If you’re using Whiteboard with a work or school account, your administrator may have configured which settings you’re able to change.

>[!NOTE]
> If you’re the administrator for your organization, there are privacy settings for Whiteboard that you can configure on behalf of the users in your organization. For more information, see Configure privacy settings for Whiteboard for your organization.
