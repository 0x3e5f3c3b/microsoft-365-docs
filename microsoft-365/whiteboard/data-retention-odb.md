# Data retention for Microsoft Whiteboard in OneDrive for Business

Data is stored as .whiteboard files in OneDrive for Business. An average whiteboard may be anywhere from 50KB to 1MB in size and located wherever your OneDrive for Business content resides. To check where new data is created, see [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/o365-data-locations) and look at the location for OneDrive for Business. All properties that apply to general files in OneDrive for Business also apply to Whiteboard, with the exception of external sharing.

Managing Whiteboard data can be done using existing OneDrive for Business controls. For more information, see the [OneDrive guide for enterprises](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/plan-onedrive-enterprise).

You can use existing OneDrive for Business tooling to satisfy data subject requests (DSRs) for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Whiteboard files can be moved in the same way as other content in OneDrive for Business. However, share links and permissions cannot move.

Data controls supported today:

- Retention policies
- Quota
- DLP
- eDiscovery
- Legal hold

Data controls coming in future:

- Sensitivity labels
- Auditing
- Analytics
- Storing whiteboards in SharePoint sites
