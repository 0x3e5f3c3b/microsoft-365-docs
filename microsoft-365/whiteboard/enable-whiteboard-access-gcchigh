# How to enable, disable, and manage Whiteboard data

## Manage Whiteboard Access

Whiteboard on OneDrive for Business is enabled by default for applicable Microsoft 365 tenants. It can be enabled or disabled at a tenant-wide level. You should also ensure that “Microsoft Whiteboard Services” is set to enabled in the Azure Active Directory Admin Center > Enterprise Applications.

Controlling access to Whiteboard can be done in the following ways:
1. Enable or disable Whiteboard for your entire tenant using the SharePoint Admin PSH module
1. Show or hide a whiteboard for specific users in meetings using a Teams meeting policy. The whiteboard will still be visible via web, native clients, and the Teams tab Applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Whiteboard on ODB does not appear in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Teams policy (#2 listed above) only hides Whiteboard entry points, it does not prevent the users from using Whiteboard. Conditional Access (#3 listed above) prevents access to Whiteboard, but does not hide the entry points.
