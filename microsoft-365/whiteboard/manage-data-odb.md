# Manage data for Microsoft Whiteboard in OneDrive for Business

Data is stored as .whiteboard files in OneDrive for Business. An average whiteboard might be anywhere from 50 KB to 1 MB in size and located wherever your OneDrive for Business content is. To check where new data is created, see [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/o365-data-locations). Look at the location for OneDrive for Business. All properties that apply to general files in OneDrive for Business also apply to Whiteboard, except for external sharing.

Managing Whiteboard data can be done using existing OneDrive for Business controls. For more information, see the [OneDrive guide for enterprises](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/plan-onedrive-enterprise).

You can use existing OneDrive for Business tooling to satisfy data subject requests (DSRs) for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Whiteboard files can be moved in the same way as other content in OneDrive for Business. However, share links and permissions can't move.

Data controls supported today:

- Retention policies
- Quota
- DLP
- eDiscovery
- Legal hold

Data controls coming in future:

- Sensitivity labels
- Auditing
- Analytics
- Storing whiteboards in SharePoint sites
