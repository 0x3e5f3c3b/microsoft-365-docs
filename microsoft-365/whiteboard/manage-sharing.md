# Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard in OneDrive for Business

Sharing whiteboards in web or native clients allow sharing with specific people or your entire organization. Sharing whiteboards in Teams meetings shares with everyone in the meeting using a link that is accessible to your entire organization.

Support for sharing only with specific people during a Teams meeting is on the roadmap.

External access is not yet supported, but will be made available in multiple stages:

- **Stage 1** - External access for the duration a Teams meeting. During the meeting, users in your organization can initiate sharing a whiteboard. Anyone outside your organization will be able to view and edit the whiteboard. When the meeting ends, they will no longer have access. This stage will have a setting for enabling or disabling it.

- **Stage 2** - External access for more long-term sharing. Users in your organization will be able to share whiteboards similar to other content in OneDrive for Business. This stage will be controlled using the existing sharing controls in OneDrive for Business.
