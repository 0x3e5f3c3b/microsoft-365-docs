# Set up Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization

Whiteboard is automatically enabled for applicable Microsoft 365 tenants. Users can sign into the Windows 10, iOS, web, and Teams experiences, unless youâ€™ve chosen to disable the service.

To enable or disable Whiteboard for your tenant, do the following:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

2. On the admin center home page, go to the **Search** box in the top right, and then type *Whiteboard*.

3. In the search results, click or tap **Whiteboard settings**.

4. On the **Whiteboard** panel, toggle **Turn Whiteboard on or off for your entire organization** to **On**. 

5. Click or tap **Save**.
